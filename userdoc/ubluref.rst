Overview
========

`Ublu <https://github.com/jwoehr/ublu>`__ is a tool for ad-hoc process
automation primarily aimed at `IBM
i <http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/power/software/i/>`__ ®.

| The Java command line ``java ublu.Ublu`` [args ...] invokes an
  extensible object-disoriented interpretive language named Ublu
  intended for interaction between any Java platform on the one hand,
  and OS400 (IBM i Series OS ®) and IBM z/VM ® SMAPI operations
  programming on the other. The language is :ref:`multithreaded  <TASK>`
  and offers a :ref:`client-server  <Server_mode>` mode. It also possesses
  a built-in single-step :ref:`debugger  <Debugger>`.

-  Access to the i Series OS server is implemented via the `JTOpen
   library <http://jt400.sourceforge.net/>`__.
-  Access to z/VM SMAPI is provided via the
   `PigIron <http://pigiron.sourceforge.net/>`__ library (see the
   :ref:`smapi  <smapi>` command).
-  Interoperation between the DB2 for i Series database and
   `Postgresql <http://www.postgresql.org/>`__ open source database is
   provided (see the :ref:`db  <db>` command).
-  Terminal "screen-scraping" automation is provided via
   `tn5250j <https://github.com/tn5250j>`__ (see the
   :ref:`tn5250  <tn5250>` command).

| "\ **Object-disoriented**" means that Ublu is a procedural language
  with function definitions which is implemented on top of
  object-oriented Java libraries. Ublu manipulates objects constructed
  in the underlying environment without forcing the user to know very
  much about the object architecture. By way of analogy, consider how
  resources in a hierarchical network environment are flattened out for
  ease of use by
  `LDAP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol>`__.
  In a similar fashion, Ublu conceals many details while still providing
  complete access should a program require it, e.g., via the
  :ref:`calljava <calljava>` command.

**Ublu** operates in four (4) modes:

#. as a command-line utility
#. as an interpreter
#. as a text file program executor via the ``include`` command
#. As a TCP/IP port listening server

| In any mode, Ublu reads a line and then consumes one or more
  :ref:`commands  <Command>` and their arguments and attempts to execute
  them. In certain cases, text parsing crosses line boundaries, e.g.,
  when a :ref:`quoted string  <Quoted_strings>` or `execution
  block <#Execution_blocks>`__ extends for multiple lines.

Ublu provides the command :ref:`FUNC  <FUNC>` to define functions with
argument lists which can later be invoked with appropriate arguments.

Commands and command features are steadily being added to the repertoire
of Ublu. Suggestions for added commands or extensions to extant commands
are welcome and should be made via whatever ticketing system is present
on the site where Ublu is distributed.

Installation
============

Ublu is distributed as an archive containing

-  ``ublu.jar``

   -  the base system

-  the ``lib`` directory

   -  libraries Ublu depends on for execution

-  the ``examples`` directory

   -  examples of Ublu usage

-  the ``extensions`` directory

   -  extensions to the base Ublu system written in Ublu itself

-  documentation

   -  javadoc
   -  userdoc

-  edit modes
-  licenses
-  *miscellaneous*

Alternatively, you can `download the full
source <https://github.com/jwoehr/ublu>`__ or check it out via ``git``
or ``svn`` from ``https://github.com/jwoehr/ublu.git``

The ``lib`` directory contains third-party .jar files containing classes
referenced by Ublu. The ``lib`` directory should be a subdirectory of
the directory containing ``ublu.jar`` .

We recommend the following layout:

    ``/opt/ublu/ublu.jar``
     ``/opt/ublu/lib``
     ``/opt/ublu/examples``
     ``/opt/ublu/extensions``
     ... etc.

Then define a function for your login shell:

-  ``bash``

   -  ``function ublu () { java -jar /opt/ublu/ublu.jar $*         }``

-  ``ksh``

   -  ``function ublu { java -jar /opt/ublu/ublu.jar $*;         }``

Invocation
==========

    | **``java ublu.Ublu [args ...]``** *(set classpath first)*
    |  *or*
    |  **``java -jar ublu.jar``** **``[args ...]``** *(for use if the
      lib directory containing open source support jars is a
      subdirectory of the directory containing* *ublu.jar)*

    | If the ``lib`` directory is a subdirectory of the directory in
      which ``ublu.jar`` resides, Ublu can be invoked via ``java -jar``
      as shown. Otherwise, prior to invocation the CLASSPATH must be set
      to include each of the supporting .jar files found in the lib
      directory.

-  Ublu commences by initializing the `main
   interpreter <#Main_interpreter>`__ and processing the arguments to
   the invocation.

   -  Any initial arguments starting with the dash character ( ``-`` )
      are taken to be switches to the Ublu invocation itself and are
      processed immediately.
   -  Any remaining arguments beginning with the first argument which
      does not start with a dash are passed as the initial input line to
      the interpreter.

-  When invoked with no non-switch command line arguments, Ublu prints
   to standard error information about the build including time/date
   stamp, open source usage and copyright before the main interpreter
   prompts. Then the main interpreter prompts and awaits interactive
   input.
-  The switches to Ublu invocation are as follows:

   -  ``-s`` by itself means "silent, no introductory greeting". When
      ``-include`` or ``-i`` is also present, it has another meaning
      (described below).

      -  Another way to avoid the introductory greeting message when
         invoking in interpret mode is to append the single command
         :ref:`interpret <interpret>` to the invocation command line.
         This nests an interpreter and thus the main interpreter has not
         yet completed the initial command line.

   -  ``-include`` or ``-i`` means that the first non-switch item in the
      command line is the name of an Ublu source file to
      :ref:`include  <include>`. If ``-s`` is also one of the switches
      passed to Ublu, then the include will be a silent include. After
      the include, the rest of the command line will be parsed and
      executed as Ublu commands by the main interpreter, after which the
      main interpreter will take normal interactive input.

-  When invoked with non-switch arguments and none of the switches were
   ``-include``, Ublu will execute the arguments as if one line of
   commands were issued to the main interpreter and then exit.

   -  To continue in interpretive mode after invoking Ublu with a
      command line including arguments, make the last argument the
      command :ref:`interpret <interpret>` . This nests an interpreter
      and thus the main interpreter has not yet completed the initial
      command line.

-  Ublu upon exit returns a result code indicating the success of the
   last command that Ublu processed.

   -  0 is SUCCESS
   -  1 is FAILURE

Memory requirements
-------------------

| Ublu ordinarily runs well with default Java memory values. However, in
  performing database operations on large databases one may be forced to
  boost the heap allocation considerably on invocation, e.g.

    **``java -Xms4g -Xmx4g -jar /opt/ublu/ublu.jar``** ...

| which allocates 4 gigabytes.

Interpreter
-----------

| As an interpreter, one or more commands with their arguments can be
  issued on a line. The commands will be executed in sequence. If any
  command fails, generally the interpreter will abandon the rest of the
  commands on the line and return to the prompt. The interpreter mode
  prompt is a right-arrow ( ``>`` ) but will have a number to the left
  of it (e.g., ``1>``) if in a nested interpreter sublevel.

Nested interpreter sublevel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| The :ref:`interpret <interpret>` command can be used to enter a
  nested interpreter sublevel, an interpreter nested within the previous
  level of interpreter.

| State is inherited by a nested interpreter sublevel from the previous
  level of interpreter.

| Some state persists in the previous level of interpreter when the
  nested interpreter sublevel ends and some is lost.

| When the sublevel ends (via :ref:`bye <bye>` or Ctl-D),

-  :ref:`FUNC <FUNC>` definitions made in the sublevel persist.
-  :ref:`Tuple  <Tuple_Variables>` definitions made in the sublevel
   persist.
-  :ref:`Constant  <Constants>` definitions made in the sublevel are lost.

Main interpreter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| The instance of the interpreter presented to the user upon program
  invocation is called the **main interpreter** to distinguish it from
  :ref:`nested interpreter sublevels  <Nested_interpreter_sublevel>` and
  from (possibly multiple) interpreter instances created in `server
  mode <#Server_mode>`__.

Server mode
-----------

| Ublu can launch multiple TCP/IP port servers that accept connections
  and bind them to individual :ref:`interpreter  <Interpreter>` sessions.
  This allows remote applications such as web applications to execute
  Ublu commands and receive their output. The default listener port is
  43860. See the ``server`` command.

| The ``server`` command can also be used to interpret a single
  :ref:`execution block  <Execution_blocks>` for each connection and then
  disconnect at the end of interpreting the block. This allows the user
  to connect to a "canned program" instead of gaining access to the full
  interpreter.

Commandline
-----------

| Invoked as a command line application with or more commands following
  the :ref:`invocation  <Invocation>` on the shell command line, the
  commands and their arguments are processed as in the interpreter, then
  the application exits. If one of the commands is
  :ref:`interpret <interpret>`, then the application continues to run
  until that interpreter exits when that interpreter encounters the
  ``bye`` or :ref:`exit <exit>` command. ``exit`` always exits, but
  ``bye`` only unnests one interpreter level. If that interpreter is the
  :ref:`main interpreter  <Main_interpreter>`, Ublu exits.

Input
-----

| Input for the :ref:`main interpreter  <Main_interpreter>` can come from
  the console or from standard input when Ublu is invoked using some
  form of shell redirection, e.g., shell pipes ( ``|`` ) or "here
  documents" ( ``<<`` ).

When interpreter input comes from standard in, prompting is suppressed.

| In :ref:`server mode  <Server_mode>`, input comes from the network socket
  and prompting is suppressed.

Output
------

| In :ref:`interpreter  <Interpreter>` and :ref:`commandline  <Commandline>`
  mode, command output of Ublu is written to standard out, with the
  exception of the following which are written to standard error:

-  error and exception mesages
-  some user informational messages which appear in interpretive mode,
   such as the initial version message, copyright message
-  all help and usage messages
-  the prompt

| When automating system tasks, it may be helpful to redirect stderr
  from the shell command line via ``2>/dev/null`` to discard
  miscellaneous interpreter informational output. This, however,
  discards error messages as well.

In :ref:`server mode  <Server_mode>`, Ublu standard out is connected the
network socket. However, Ublu standard error output remains attached to
the invoking interpreter's standard error. This makes the `main
interpreter <#Main_interpreter>`__ a monitor of errors occurring in
server threads.

Executing commands from a file
------------------------------

| Interpretation of a text file of :ref:`commands  <Commands>` and
  :ref:`functions  <Functions>` is performed via the command ``include``.

Launch your application from a shell script autogenerated via ``gensh``
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Ublu offers a command :ref:`gensh <gensh>` which autogenerates a shell
script to process arguments to your custom function via command line
switches and invoke your custom function with those arguments. This is
the Ublu model for runtime program delivery.

Debugger
--------

| The :ref:`dbug  <dbug>` command provides interactive single-step
  debugging of an :ref:`execution block  <Execution_blocks>`.

Parsing and syntax
------------------

| Parsing and syntax are simplistic.

| Input is parsed left-to-right, with no lookback. Each sequence of
  non-whitespace characters separated from other non-whitespace by at
  least one whitespace character is parsed as an element. No extra
  whitespace is preserved in parsing, not even within `quoted
  strings <#Quoted_strings>`__ (with the important exception that a
  quoted string is always returned with a blank space as the last
  character).

| **Note** that the simplistic parser imposes one particularly arbitrary
  limitation in that within an :ref:`execution block  <Execution_blocks>`
  neither the block opener ``$[`` nor the block closer ``]$`` are
  allowed to appear inside a quoted string. If you need to have those
  symbols in a quoted string, the limitation is easy to get around, as
  follows:

    ``put -to @foo ${ $[ }$``\ ```` ``put -to @bar ${     $] }$``\ ````
    ``FOR @i in @foo $[ put -from @i     ]$``\ ```` *``$[``*\ ````
    ``FOR @i     in @bar $[ put -from @i ]$``\ ```` *``$]``*

Quoted strings
--------------

| Quoting of strings is achieved by placing the string between two
  elements **``${``** and **``}$``** . The open and close elements of a
  quoted string must each be separated by at least one space from the
  contents of the string and from any leading or following commands or
  arguments.

Whitespace between non-whitespace elements of the string is compacted
into single spaces  ``${ This     is         a quoted     string.   }$``
represents ``This is a quoted string.`` A quoted string is always
returned by the parser with a blank space at the end of it.

A quoted string can span multiple lines. When end-of-line is reached in
the interpreter after the open-quote glyph ( ``${`` ) without finding
the close-quote glyph ( ``}$`` ), then string parsing continues and the
prompt changes for any lines following until the close-quote glyph is
encountered. The string parsing continuation prompt is the open-quote
glyph surrounded in parentheses ``(${)`` .

| **Note** that the simplistic parser imposes one particularly arbitrary
  limitation in that within an :ref:`execution block  <Execution_blocks>`
  neither the block opener ``$[`` nor the block closer ``]$`` are
  allowed to appear inside a quoted string. If you need to have those
  symbols in a quoted string, the limitation is easy to get around, as
  follows:

    ``put -to @foo ${ $[ }$``\ ```` ``put -to @bar ${     $] }$``\ ````
    ``FOR @i in @foo $[ put -from @i     ]$``\ ```` *``$[``*\ ````
    ``FOR @i     in @bar $[ put -from @i ]$``\ ```` *``$]``*

Tuple variables
---------------

| A tuple variable is a :ref:`autoinstancing  <Tuple_autoinstancing>`
  name-value pair that is either globally accessible within the given
  interpreter session or made :ref:`local  <Local_variables>` to a function
  definition via the :ref:`LOCAL <LOCAL>` command. Tuples are always
  referenced with a "@" as the first character of their name, e.g.,
  ``@session``. You can direct any kind of object to a tuple with the
  :ref:``-to`` ``@tuplename`` `dash-command  <Dash_Command>` (adjunct to
  commands which support that) and retrieve the value with
  ``-from   @tuplename`` (adjunct to commands which support that).
|  Tuples can be directly manipulated via the :ref:`put <put>` and
  :ref:`tuple <tuple>` commands.

Default Tuples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Ublu interpreter starts with certain tuples already defined, as
shown in the chart below:

    +--------------+-------------+--------------------------------------+
    | *name*       | *value*     | *notes*                              |
    +--------------+-------------+--------------------------------------+
    | ``@true``    | ``true``    | can be used for conditionals, etc.   |
    +--------------+-------------+--------------------------------------+
    | ``@false``   | ``false``   | can be used for conditionals, etc.   |
    +--------------+-------------+--------------------------------------+

These defaults are not constant and can be overwritten at runtime via
normal tuple manipulation.

Tuple naming
~~~~~~~~~~~~

| A tuple name can consist of any string of printable characters
  starting with the initial ``@`` marker *except* that the name may not
  start with the reserved sequence ``@///``\ *number*. A tuple name of
  this form (e.g., ``@///19``) denotes a temporary variable used in
  function argument binding. Currently the protection of this form of
  tuple name is not enforced by the interpreter. **Unpredictable
  results** can occur if you use this form to name a tuple variable.

Tuple autoinstancing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A tuple springs into being in the global tuple map when a previously
unused tuple name is used as a :ref:`destination datasink  <Datasinks>` or
as a parameter (input or output) to a :ref:`function  <Functions>`. When
autoinstanced in this fashion, the new tuple's value is ``null``.
Alternatively, you can create a tuple variable using the tuple command,
e.g. ``tuple -true @foo`` will set ``@foo`` to ``true`` if it exists
already, or will create ``@foo`` and set it to ``true`` if it does not
yet exist.

Tuple stack
-----------

| The system maintains a Last In, First Out (LIFO) stack of tuple
  variables for programming convenience manipulated via the
  :ref:`lifo <lifo>` command.
|  A command and its dash-commands that expect tuple arguments can also
  take the argument **``~``** ("tilde") which signifies "pop the tuple
  from the tuple stack". An error will result if the stack is empty.
|  When a command references a source or destination
  :ref:`datasink  <Datasinks>` via the ``-to`` or ``-from`` dash-commands,
  that datasink may also be **``~``** ("tilde"), meaning the source or
  destination is the tuple stack. Non-tuples, e.g, strings put to a
  destination datasink via ``-to ~`` in this fashion are automatically
  wrapped in an anonymous tuple. Hence the following session:

    ``> put -to ~ ${ but not a clever test }$     > put -to ~ ${ this is a test }$     > string -to ~ -cat ~ ~     > put ~     this is a test but not a clever test``

Autonomic Tuple Variables
-------------------------

If the interpreter encounters a tuple variable or the tuple stack pop
symbol :ref:``~`` (tilde) when it is expecting a `command  <Commands>`, it
checks the value of that variable. If the value is of a class in the
list of autonomes, that is, classes whose instances are generally passed
as the argument to the `eponymous
dash-command <#Eponymous_dash-command__--_>`__ of a specific Ublu
command, that command is invoked with tuple as the eponymous argument,
along with any :ref:`dash-commands  <Dash_Command>` and/or arguments which
follow. If the variable is not autonomic, the interpreter reports an
error.

Thus, the third, fourth and sixth commands of the following example
using :ref:`ifs  <ifs>` to get the size of a file in the Integrated File
System are equivalent:

::

    > as400 -to @mysys MYSYS.com myid mYpAssWoRd
    > ifs -to @f -as400 @mysys -file /home/myid/.profile
    > ifs -- @f -size
    56
    > @f -size
    56
    > lifo -push @f
    > ~ -size
    56

Autonomic tuple variables offer a useful
:ref:`object-disoriented  <Object-disoriented>` shorthand which, along with
:ref:`tuple stack  <Tuple_stack>` wizardry, one should consider avoiding in
larger programs in the interest of clarity.

-  To test whether the tuple variable ``@foo`` is autonomic, use
   ``tuple -autonomic     @foo``
-  To display whether the tuple variable ``@foo`` is autonomic, use
   ``tuple -autonome     @foo``
-  To display a list of all autonomic classes and the Ublu commands they
   invoke, use ``tuple -autonomes``

Numbers
-------

| Numbers are signed integers and generally can be input as decimal, hex
  (0x00), or octal (000). See also the :ref:`num  <num>` command.

Plainwords
----------

| Any whitespace-delimited sequence of non-whitespace characters
  provided as an argument to a command or dash-command  or function is a
  *plainword*. A plainword can be used in most cases to represent a
  number or a single whitespace-delimited textual item where a `tuple
  variable <#Tuple_Variables>:ref:`__ or `quoted string  <Quoted_strings>`
  would have to be used to contain longer whitespace-including strings
  of text.

Constants
---------

| Constants are created via the :ref:`const  <const>` command. Constants
  have a string value. The name of a constant has the form ``*somename``
  and can be used as the :ref:`argument  <Argument>` to a
  :ref:`command  <Command>` or :ref:`dash-command  <Dash_Command>` where the
  syntax notation represent the argument as ``~@{something}`` and only
  in such position. Constants are not expanded within quoted strings.
  Constants cannot be used as the argument to a ``-from`` or ``-to``
  dash-command. :ref:`Plainwords  <Plainwords>` resembling constants, i.e.,
  starting with an asterisk \* are not mistaken for constants if they
  have not been defined as such.

Constants defined in an interpreter level appear in its `nested
interpreter sublevels <#Nested_interpreter_sublevel>`__. However,
constants defined in nested interpreter sublevels do not persist into
the previous interpreter level.

Execution blocks
----------------

An **execution block** is a body of commands enclosed between the block
opener ``$[`` and the block closer ``]$`` . Execution blocks are used in
:ref:`functor  <Functors>` declarations (callable routines) via the
:ref:`FUN <FUN>` command and with conditional control flow commands
such as :ref:`FOR <FOR>:ref:` and ```IF`` - ``THEN`` - ``ELSE``  <IF>` to
express the limit of a code phrase in a condition.

    ``IF @varname THEN $[ command command .. ]$ ELSE $[     command command ]$``

| is a generalized example of block usage.

| An execution block can contain :ref:`local variable  <Local_variables>`
  declarations and their use. A local variable declaration hides
  identically named variables from the global context and from any
  enclosing block. Inner blocks to the declaring block have access to
  the locals in enclosing blocks, unless, of course, an identically
  named variable has been declared local to the enclosed block.

**Note** that the "comment-to-end-of-line" command
:ref:`# <comment_introducer>` should not ever be used in an execution
block! An execution block is treated as one command line, so the comment
command will devour the rest of the block.

| **Note** that the simplistic parser imposes one particularly arbitrary
  limitation in that within an :ref:`execution block  <Execution_blocks>`
  neither the block opener ``$[`` nor the block closer ``]$`` are
  allowed to appear inside a quoted string. If you need to have those
  symbols in a quoted string, the limitation is easy to get around, as
  follows:

    ``put -to @foo ${ $[ }$``\ ```` ``put -to @bar ${     $] }$``\ ````
    ``FOR @i in @foo $[ put -from @i     ]$``\ ```` *``$[``*\ ````
    ``FOR @i     in @bar $[ put -from @i ]$``\ ```` *``$]``*

| An execution block may span several lines, however, the opening
  bracket ( ``$[`` ) of the block *must* appear on the same line with
  and directly after the conditional control flow command operating upon
  it.

| Execution blocks may be nested.

| In the :ref:`Tips and Tricks  <Tips_and_Tricks>` section of this document
  is an example which will `get a list of active interactive jobs and
  search that list for specific
  jobs <#Get_a_list_of_active_interactive_jobs>`__.

Local variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| An execution block can have local `tuple
  variables <#Tuple_Variables>`__ declared via the
  :ref:`LOCAL <LOCAL>` command whose names hide variables of the same
  name which may exist outside the execution block. Locals disappear at
  the end of the block in which they are declared.

Local variables can be used safely even when a global tuple variable
coincidentally of the same name is passed in as a function argument; no
collision results, and both the local and the function argument can be
referenced.

    *Example*

    | ``FUNC foo ( a ) $[``\ ```` ``    LOCAL @a``\ ````
      ``    put -to @a ${ inner @a     }``\ ``$``\ ````
      ``    put -n -s     ${ outer a: }$ put -from @@a``\ ````
      ``    put -n -s ${ local a: }$ put -from     @a``\ ````
      ``]$``\ ```` ``put -to @a ${     outer @a }$``\ ````
      ``foo ( @a )``\ ```` ``outer a:  outer @a`` ````
      ``local a:  inner @a``

Functors
--------

| A functors is an anonymous :ref:`execution block  <Execution_blocks>`
  created via :ref:`FUN <FUN>` which can then be stored in `tuple
  variable <#Tuple_Variables>`__ and invoked via :ref:`CALL <CALL>`
  and/or associated with a name entry in the function dictionary via
  ``defun``. Arguments can be passed to the functor. Arguments are
  call-by-reference; the resolution of these arguments is discussed
  under :ref:`Function Parameter Binding  <Function_Parameter_Binding>`.

Functions
---------

| A function is a :ref:`functor  <Functors>` associated with a name entry
  in the :ref:`function dictionary  <Function_Dictionary>`, usually via
  ``FUNC`` but also via the combination of :ref:`FUN <FUN>` and
  :ref:`defun <defun>`.

The function dictionary is searched after the list of built-in commands.
Dictionaries can be listed, saved, restored and merged via the
:ref:`dict <dict>` command. Arguments can be passed to the block. All
arguments are passed by reference, i.e., passing a `tuple
variable <#Tuple_Variables>`__ to a function argument list passes the
tuple itself, not the tuple's value, and any alteration of the argument
alters the tuple referred to in the argument list. The resolution of
these arguments is discussed under `Function Parameter
Binding <#Function_Parameter_Binding>`__.

``> FUNC yadda ( a ) $[``
``FOR @word in @@a $[ put   -n -s -from @word put ${ yadda-yadda ... }$ ]$``
``]$``\ ```` ``> put -to @words ${ this that   t'other }$``\ ````
``> yadda ( @words   )``\ ```` *``this yadda-yadda ...``* *````*
*``that yadda-yadda ...``* *````* *``t'other yadda-yadda ...``* ````
``> dict -list``\ ```` *``#   yadda ublu.util.Functor@1d4b0e9``\ ````*
*``FUNC yadda ( a ) $[ FOR @word in @@a $[ put -n -s -from   @word put ${ yadda-yadda ... }$ ]$  ]$``*

| ``> dict -save -to mydict`` ```` ``>   FUNC -delete yadda``\ ````
  ``> dict   -list``\ ```` ```` ``> dict -restore   -from mydict``\ ````
  ``> dict   -list``\ ````
  *``# yadda   ublu.util.Functor@14fd510``\ ````*
  *``FUNC yadda ( a ) $[ FOR @word in @@a $[ put -n -s -from   @word put ${ yadda-yadda ... }$ ]$  ]$``*
|  *See also* the :ref:`FUN <FUN>` and :ref:`defun <defun>`
  commands.

Function Parameter Binding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ublu's interpreter being purely a text interpreter, performing (almost)
no tokenization during interpretation and compilation, function
parameter binding is effected by runtime rewriting ("token pasting") of
argument references (e.g., ``@@some_arg``) in the execution block to the
actual positional parameter value provided at the time the function is
called.

Arguments passed to a function or functor can be

-  :ref:`@variable <Tuple_Variables>`
-  :ref:`plainword  <Plain_words>`
-  :ref:`quoted string  <Quoted_strings>`
-  :ref:`block  <Execution_blocks>`

Arguments other than blocks or quoted strings are handled as follows:

-  If the argument provided is a simple lex, e.g., ``foo`` or ``1234``,
   or a :ref:`\*const  <const>`, that text is substituted uncritically at
   runtime for all references to that argument in the function body.
-  If the argument provided is a :ref:`tuple variable  <Tuple_Variables>`,
   a temporary alias for the tuple variable named in the invocation
   argument is created in a local extension to the tuple map and
   references to the argument are rewritten with the name of the
   temporary in the function's execution block.
-  If the argument is the tuple stack pop symbol ``~`` that symbol will
   appear at runtime wherever the argument is substituted in the
   function body.

Thus, in the case of a function

    ``foo ( a b c ) $[ put @@a put @@b put @@c ]$``

called with arguments

    ``foo ( @bar woof @zotz )``

is effectively seen at invocation by the interpreter as

    ``$[ put @bar put woof put @zotz ]$``

The temporary alias actually pasted for tuple variable arguments to
functions can be seen in the debugger.

It is perfectly acceptable to name function parameters with the same
names as command or functions. But this practice can detract from the
readability of the code, especially if using the `syntax coloring edit
modes <#Syntax_coloring_edit_modes>`__ provided with Ublu.

Function Dictionary
-------------------

| Function definitions are stored in the function dictionary.

| :ref:`Interpreter  <Interpreter>` instances launched by the ``interpret``
  command inherit the current function dictionary. Any additions within
  an interpreter instance are lost when the instance exits back to its
  parent interpreter instance.

You can view the current function dictionary or save it to a file or
:ref:`tuple variable  <Tuple_Variables>` and later restore it or merge it
with the current dictionary. See the :ref:`dict <dict>` and
:ref:`savesys  <savesys>` commands.

User ID and password
--------------------

| You supply a user ID and a password in the argument list for any Ublu
  command which accesses an AS/400 (iSeries, System/i) host, or for
  creating an instance of the host using the :ref:`as400 <as400>`
  command so that you can employ the ``-as400`` dash-command with
  subsequent commands in lieu of constant repetition of the system name,
  userid and password. On system operations, if the user ID or password
  is incorrect, you will be prompted to enter the correct user ID and/or
  password, upon completion of which the command will proceed.

    ``> joblist testsys frrd oopswrong``\ ``     Please enter a valid userid for testsys: fred``
    ``Please enter a valid password for testsys (will not     echo):``\ ````
    ``000000/QSYS/SCPF``\ ```` ``000736/QSYS/QSYSARB``\ ````
    ``000737/QSYS/QSYSARB2``
     ... etc.

| The behavior of Ublu when a signon attempt fails can be modified. See
  the :ref:`as400 <as400>` and :ref:`props <props>` commands for
  details.
|  DB400 database operations behave differently with regard to an
  incorrect userid or password. Unlike the JTOpen systems operation
  code, the JTOpen JDBC driver does not provide a programmable exit for
  application code to handle an incorrect userid or password, and
  instead handles the exception itself by attempting to launch a
  1990's-style Java AWT window prompting for userid and password. If
  your environment supports a GUI, all is well: you can supply the
  correct userid and password. On the other hand, if your environment
  does not support a GUI, then the operation fails and a confusing
  exception is thrown complaining about the absence of a windowing
  system. You can avoid this windowing behavior and just allow the
  operation to fail on incorrect userid/password with an understandable
  exception by adding the following connection property
  :ref:`dash-command  <Dash_Command>` to the string of dash-commands for
  the ``db`` command:

    ``-property prompt false``

| which adds ``;prompt=false`` to the URL for the JDBC connection and
  disables the windowing password prompt.

Commands
========

| Commands are the verbs of Ublu. Some have only language meaning, but
  the most important commands operate directly upon a host system
  affecting its data and operation. Be sure you understand what you are
  doing when you use an Ublu command!

| Access to i Series hosts is provided through IBM's open source `JTOpen
  library <http://jt400.sourceforge.net/>`__.

| Access to z/VM SMAPI is provided through the author's open source
  `PigIron library <http://pigiron.sourceforge.net/>`__.

Command Structure
-----------------

| Commands are conceptually structured in three parts

#. command
#. dash-commands
#. arguments

| Not all commands have dash-commands. Not all commands take arguments.
  Usually they take one or the other. The general order of the three
  parts is as follows:

    *command [dash-command dash-command-argument [dash-command-argument
    dash-command-argument ...] ] command-argument [command-argument ...]
    *

| Where :ref:`dash-commands  <Dash_Command>` are give in square brackets,
  e.g., ``[-foo ~@{bazz}]`` the dash-command is optional and not
  required.

| In this documentation, square brackets and ellipses are used to
  describe the command structure. Those square brackets and ellipses are
  not part of the syntax of Ublu, merely documentation notation. See the
  examples given in the documentation and in the ``examples`` directory
  in the distribution.

In this documentation, where multiple dash-commands are enclosed
collectively in a outer pair of square brackets and individually
enclosed in square brackets and the bracketed dash-commands separated by
the .OR. bar ( \| ), e.g., then the dash-commands are a set of mutually
exclusive optional dash-commands, e.g.,
``[[-foo ~@{bazz}] | [-arf   ~@{woof}]]``

| Where square brackets are missing from a dash-command description, the
  dash-command, or one of the alternative of a series of dash-commands
  separated in the description by the .OR. bar ( \| ) is required.

| Some dash-commands are required in some contexts, and not in others.
  Such cases are explained in the explanatory text for the command.

Command
~~~~~~~

| A *command* is a one-word command name. It is the first element of any
  Ublu command invocation.

Dash Command
~~~~~~~~~~~~

| A *dash-command* is a modifier to the command, itself often possessing
  an argument or string of arguments.

| All dash-commands to a command must appear on the same line with the
  command, except that a :ref:`quoted string  <Quoted_strings>` once
  started may span line breaks, thus extending a command over two or
  more lines.

| If dash-commands specify conflicting operations, the last dash-command
  encountered in command processing is the operative choice.

Often one dash-command is actually the default operation for the
command, so that if no dash-command is provided, this default provides
the operation of the command anyway. These defaults are noted in the
command descriptions.

Eponymous dash-command ( ``--`` )
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| Many commands are used to create objects of various kinds and store
  them in :ref:`tuple variables  <Tuple_Variables>`. Later, these same
  command operate on these same objects which they themselves have
  created. This sort of command references the tuple containing such an
  object via an eponymous dash-command, e.g, ``job -job @some_job`` etc.
  This eponymous dash-command can generally be replaced by ``--``
  instead, so the example just given could equally be written
  ``job -- @some_job`` etc.

Order of Dash Commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| Often the order in which dash-commands appear on a line does not
  matter, but sometimes it does. To be safe, dash commands should
  generally follow the command in this order:

#. the :ref:`eponymous dash-command  <Eponymous_dash-command__--_>` or the
   one representing the object being operated upon
#. the two :ref:`data sink  <Datasinks>` dash-commands, ``-from`` and
   ``-to`` , if used
#. any other dash-commands

There are exceptions to this ordering, e.g, the eponymous dash-command
must come *last* for the :ref:`dbug <dbug>` command.

Argument
~~~~~~~~

| An *argument* is the object or, for multiple arguments, list of
  objects necessary for command execution.

Commands may have arguments, and their dash-commands may also have their
own arguments.

| All arguments to a command or dash-command must appear on the same
  line as the command or dash-command and cannot span a line-break,
  except that a :ref:`quoted string  <Quoted_strings>` once started may
  span line breaks, thus extending a command over two or more lines.

| In command descriptions:

-  When an argument is decorated with the :ref:`tuple  <Tuple_Variables>`
   character ``@`` , as in ``-somedashcommand @tuple`` this signifies
   that a tuple name is expected.
-  When an argument is decorated with both the tuple character and the
   :ref:`stack-pop  <Tuple_stack>` indicator ``~`` , as in
   ``-somedashcommand ~@tuple`` this signifies that either a tuple name
   or the stack-pop indicator (popping an appropriate tuple previously
   pushed to the stack) is expected.
-  When an argument is decorated with the tuple character, the
   :ref:`stack-pop  <Tuple_stack>` indicator ``~`` and wrapped in curly
   braces, as in ``-somedashcommand ~@{some     string}`` , it signifies
   that the string argument may come from a named tuple, or a tuple
   pushed previously to the stack, or from an inline quoted string.
-  In any position where a quoted string is one of the allowed argument
   types, a simple undecorated inline lex
   (":ref:`plainword  <Plain_words>`\ ", no whitespace) is treated as a
   quoted string.
-  When the string in the description of the argument to a dash-command
   consists of alternatives separated by the .OR. bar ( ``|`` ) these
   are alternative values, usually literal, for the argument.

   -  An example is the description of the ``dpoint`` command's
      dash-command ``-type ~@{int|long|float}`` which means that
      ``-type`` expects an argument, either from a tuple or from a
      quoted string or :ref:`plainword  <Plainwords>` that is the literal
      string either ``int``, ``long``, or ``float``.

Command Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An example of a command with dash-commands and arguments is the
following:

    ``job -job @j -to @subsys -get subsystem``

-  ``job`` is the command\ ``.``
-  ``-job @j`` is the ``job`` command's dash-command for providing the
   command with an already instanced tuple variable representing the
   server job the command is to operate upon.
-  ``-to @subsys`` is the ``job`` command's dash-command indicating the
   :ref:`data sink  <Datasinks>` (in this case, a tuple) to which the
   output of the ``job`` command is to go. Most commands know the
   ``-to`` *datasink* dash-command
-  ``-get subsystem`` is the ``job`` command's dash-command with single
   plainword argument indicating what aspect of the job represented by
   ``@j`` we wish to examine.

**Note** that the above example could equally have been written:

    ``job -- @j -to @subsys -get subsystem``

using the :ref:`eponymous dash-command  <Eponymous_dash-command__--_>`
instead of ``-job``.

Datasinks
~~~~~~~~~

| Command descriptions reference *datasinks*. A datasink is a data
  source or a data destination.
|  Many commands offer the :ref:`dash-command  <Dash_Command>` ``-to``
  which directs the output of the command (often an object) to the
  specified datasink. Some commands offer the ``-from`` dash-command
  which assigns a source datasink for input during the command, e.g.,
  :ref:`include <include>` which reads and interprets source code can
  have its input from a file or variable.
|  A datasink is currently one of these types:

#. Standard input and output
#. Error output
#. File
#. :ref:`Tuple variable  <Tuple_Variables>`
#. Null output (discard all data directed to this datasink).

| A datasink's type is recognizable from its name.

-  ``STD:`` represents standard input and output and is the default
   destination datasink if none is explicitly provided via the ``-to``
   dash-command.\ ````
-  ``ERR:`` is the standard error output stream.
-  ``NULL:`` discards output.
-  A file can be any filename, relative or fully qualified pathname.

   -  File names are recognized in datasink assignment simply by their
      not matching one of the other name patterns for a datasink.

-  A named tuple variable is distinguished by starting with ``@`` as in
   ``@ThisIsAVar`` .

   -  The tuple variable thus named is created if it did not previously
      exist.

In the absence of the ``-to`` dash-command, the default destination
datasink of a commands is ``STD:`` (standard out).

| When a command results in an object other than a string and the
  command's destination datasink is File or Standard output the object's
  ``toString()`` method is called to provide the data.

System, Userid, Password and ``-as400``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| In order to access the iSeries (AS400) server, many commands routinely
  require in their argument string the following three items:

#. system (name or IP address)
#. userid
#. password

| All such commands allow these three arguments to be omitted if instead
  the ``-as400`` dash-command is used to supply an extant server
  instance to the command. See the :ref:`as400 <as400>` command to
  learn how create a server instance to be used and re-used.
|  Of course, the execution of commands that require extended ownership,
  access control or privilege level on the target system can only be
  executed via an account with such privileges.

Deprecation of providing system/userid/password as arguments to most commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| **Note:** Many of the oldest Ublu commands allow
  system/userid/password to be supplied as main command arguments as
  well as allowing the user to provide an as400 object via the -as400
  dash-command. The older style of command is **deprecated** and **all
  code should use the -as400 style of providing an object created by the
  :ref:`as400 <as400>` command** rather than providing credentials as
  arguments to most commands.

List of commands
----------------

| Here is the list of commands Ublu understands and their descriptions.
  Some descriptions below start with a leading-slash (/) and a number,
  indicating the number of arguments expected (excluding
  :ref:`dash-commands  <Dash_Command>`). The slash/numbers are *not* part
  of the command syntax, and only serve as documentation: do not enter
  them yourself. A plus-sign (+) after the number indicates the number
  represents a minimum number of arguments rather than an absolute
  number. Optional dash-commands are indicated in [square brackets].
  Again, the brackets are documentation, and not part of the actual
  syntax, just enter the dash-command and its argument(s), if any.

Command summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most commands provide a brief summary via ``help -cmd`` *commandname*.
That summary is repeated in the command descriptions below. The (neither
rigorous nor always entirely accurate) schematic meaning of the summary
is as follows:

    ``commandname /numargs[?]`` ``[[-dash-command [arg     arg ...]]``
    ``[-dash-command [arg arg ...]] ...]``
    ``[[-mutually-exclusive-dash-command [arg arg ...]] |     [``\ ``mutually-exclusive-dash-command``
    ``[arg arg     ...]] ...] argument argument [optional-argument] ... :     description of command's action``

    -  ``commandname`` is the name used by the interpreter for the
       command
    -  ``/numargs[?]`` is count of how many arguments are nominally
       expected by the command.

       -  an optional question-mark ? is appended if this number
          commonly varies.

          -  a typical variation in number is the use of the
             :ref:`-as400 <System_Userid>` dash-command to obviate
             repeated use of the *system* *userid* and *password*
             arguments.

    -  ``-dash-command arg`` represents a mandatory dash-command and its
       argument
    -  ``[-dash-command [arg arg ...]]`` represents an optional
       :ref:`dash-command  <Dash_Command>` with optional dash-command
       arguments.
    -  ``[[-dash-command [arg arg ...]]``
       ``[-dash-command [arg arg ...]] ...]`` represents several
       dash-commands, each of which may possess arguments.
    -  ``[-mutually-exclusive-dash-command [arg arg ...]] |       [``\ ``mutually-exclusive-dash-command``
       ``[arg arg       ...]] ...]`` represents mutually exclusive
       dash-commands which may not be used together.
    -  ``argument argument [optional-argument] ...`` represents the
       formal arguments to the command.
    -  ``description of command's action`` is just that.

    | If the first dash-command documented for the command is the
      ``-as400`` dash-command, then by use of the :ref:`as400 <as400>`
      command to store a system instance in a tuple and the subsequent
      use of the ``-as400`` dash-command, such a command can omit the
      three (3) arguments *system userid password* leaving the rest of
      the formal argument list the same as it was.

\ ``as400``
~~~~~~~~~~~

    | ``/3? [-to @var] [--,-as400,-from ~@var] [-usessl] [-ssl     ~@tf] [-new,-instance | -alive | -alivesvc     ~@{[CENTRAL|COMMAND|DATABASE|DATAQUEUE|FILE|PRINT|RECORDACCESS|SIGNON]}     | -connectsvc     ~@{[CENTRAL|COMMAND|DATABASE|DATAQUEUE|FILE|PRINT|RECORDACCESS|SIGNON]}     | -connectedsvc     ~@{[CENTRAL|COMMAND|DATABASE|DATAQUEUE|FILE|PRINT|RECORDACCESS|SIGNON]}     | -connected | -disconnect | -disconnectsvc     ~@{[CENTRAL|COMMAND|DATABASE|DATAQUEUE|FILE|PRINT|RECORDACCESS|SIGNON]}     | -ping sysname     ~@{[ALL|CENTRAL|COMMAND|DATABASE|DATAQUEUE|FILE|PRINT|RECORDACCESS|SIGNON]}     | -local | -validate | -qsvcport     ~@{[CENTRAL|COMMAND|DATABASE|DATAQUEUE|FILE|PRINT|RECORDACCESS|SIGNON]}     | -svcport     ~@{[CENTRAL|COMMAND|DATABASE|DATAQUEUE|FILE|PRINT|RECORDACCESS|SIGNON]}     ~@portnum | -setaspgrp -@{aspgrp} ~@{curlib} ~@{liblist} |     -svcportdefault | -proxy ~@{server[:portnum]} | -sockets ~@tf |     -netsockets ~@tf | -vrm ] ~@{system} ~@{user} ~@{password} :     instance, connect to, query connection, or disconnect from an     as400 system``
    |  Creates an object instance representing an AS400 system and
      manipulates that object. The instance is intended to be stored in
      a :ref:`tuple variable  <Tuple_Variables>` for later use with the
      :ref:``-as400`` `dash-command  <Dash_Command>` to many commands so
      that the *system*, *userid* and *password* need not be repeated
      with various commands.
    |  When an ``as400`` instance is no longer in use but your program
      continues, it is often best to ``-disconnect`` or
      ``-disconnectsvc``.
    |  An ``as400`` instance stored in a tuple variable ``@myas400`` is
      passed to the ``as400`` command using any one of the three
      dash-command forms:

    -  -- ``@myas400``
    -  ``-as400`` ``@myas400``
    -  ``-from`` ``@myas400``

    | This is a bit redundant but the three forms persist for historical
      reasons.
    |  The operations of the dash-commands are as shown:

    -  ``-new,-instance`` instances and puts the ``as400`` instance.
       *``-instance`` is deprecated, use ``-new`` instead*
    -  ``-usessl`` indicates connections will be made using Secure
       Sockets Layer (SSL)
    -  ``-ssl ~@tf`` indicates connections will be made using Secure
       Sockets Layer (SSL) if the value of the tuple (or pop) *~@tf* is
       ``true`` ... any other value means "no SSL".
    -  ``-alive`` puts ``true`` if the as400 instance passed to the
       ``-as400`` *@var* dash-command is connected to **any** service
       and that connection is alive, ``false`` otherwise.

       -  **Note:** on i Series OS prior to 7.1 ``alive`` behaves the
          same as ``-connected``.

    -  ``-alivesvc`` puts ``true`` if the ``as400`` instance is
       connected (``false`` otherwise) to the specified service, one of
       ``CENTRAL|COMMAND|DATABASE|DATAQUEUE|FILE|PRINT|RECORDACCESS|SIGNON``
       and that connection is alive.

       -  **Note:** on i Series OS prior to 7.1 ``-alivesvc`` behaves
          the same as ``-connectedsvc``.

    -  ``-connectsvc`` connects the ``as400`` instance to the specified
       service, one of
       ``CENTRAL|COMMAND|DATABASE|DATAQUEUE|FILE|PRINT|RECORDACCESS|SIGNON``

       -  **Note** that it is *not* usually necessary to explicitly
          connect to a service. Ublu commands perform all necessary
          connections.

    -  ``-connectedsvc`` puts ``true`` if the ``as400`` instance is
       connected (``false`` otherwise) to the specified service, one of
       ``CENTRAL|COMMAND|DATABASE|DATAQUEUE|FILE|PRINT|RECORDACCESS|SIGNON``
    -  ``-connected`` puts ``true`` if the as400 instance passed to the
       ``-as400`` *@var* dash-command is connected to **any** service,
       ``false`` otherwise.
    -  ``-disconnect`` disconnects **all** services when used with the
       ``-as400`` *@var* dash-command where *@var* refers to an
       ``as400`` instance previously instanced.
    -  ``-disconnectsvc`` disconnects the ``as400`` instance from the
       specified service, one of
       ``CENTRAL|COMMAND|DATABASE|DATAQUEUE|FILE|PRINT|RECORDACCESS|SIGNON``
    -  ``-svcport`` sets the TCP port for the specified service for when
       the port used is not the default port. A value of ``-1`` for the
       port number means to use the TCP/IP ``portmapper`` service to
       find the port.
    -  ``-setaspgrp`` resets the ASP group, the current library and the
       library list.
    -  ``-svcportdefault`` resets all service ports to their default
       values.
    -  ``-ping sysname service`` checks whether a specified TCP service
       used by Ublu, one of
       ``CENTRAL|COMMAND|DATABASE|DATAQUEUE|FILE|PRINT|RECORDACCESS|SIGNON``,
       or all such services (``ALL``) are running on the host specified
       as *sysname*.

       -  ``true`` is put if the service is available, ``false``
          otherwise.

    -  ``-local`` puts ``true`` if Ublu is running locally on an IBM i
       server.
    -  ``-proxy ~@{server[:portnum]}`` assigns the JTOpen proxy server
       (a running instance of ``com.ibm.as400.access.ProxyServer``) if
       one is being used.
    -  ``-qsvcport       ~@{[CENTRAL|COMMAND|DATABASE|DATAQUEUE|FILE|PRINT|RECORDACCESS|SIGNON]}``
       puts the port on which the ``as400`` object is currently set
       contact the named service.
    -  ``-sockets ~@tf`` if *~@tf* is ``true`` requires the as400
       instance to use socket connections instead of APIs when running
       locally on an IBM i server.
    -  ``-netsockets ~@tf`` if *~@tf* is ``true`` requires the as400
       instance to use Internet domain socket connections instead of
       Unix sockets when using sockets locally on an IBM i server.
    -  ``-validate`` validates the signon for the system+user+password
       combination represented by the ``as400`` object and ``put``\ s
       ``true`` or ``false`` accordingly.
    -  ``-vrm`` puts the Version/Release/Modification of the ``as400``
       instance as a 24-bit hex number (with leading zeroes, if any, not
       shown) of the form ``xxyyzz`` where

       -  ``xx`` is the version
       -  ``yy`` is the release
       -  ``zz`` is the modification

    | In the absence of dash-commands the default operation is
      ``-instance``.

    | When a signon fails for bad userid or incorrect password, a signon
      handler is invoked. The JTOpen class library which provides
      connection to the host has a builtin handler, which opens a GUI
      window to prompt the user if it can and fails with a mysterious
      error message if GUI capabilities are not present, e.g., in an ssh
      session which does not pass XWindows thru. There are also two
      custom handlers in Ublu, a custom handler which prompts the user
      textually, and a null handler which simply fails the login
      operation. This behavior can be controlled on a per-interpreter
      basis via the :ref:`props <props>` command:

    -  ``props -set signon.handler.type`` ``BUILTIN`` uses the JTOpen
       GUI-based handler
    -  ``props -set signon.handler.type CUSTOM`` uses the Ublu
       text-based handler
    -  ``props -set signon.handler.type NULL`` uses the Ublu
       fail-on-error handler

    | The default is ``CUSTOM`` ... users will be prompted in text mode
      in case of a signon failure.

    | In the absence of the explicit switches ``-usessl`` and ``-ssl``,
      the ``as400`` command will create SSL (Secure Socket Layer) secure
      instances if the correct property is set via the
      :ref:`props  <props>` command prior to instancing.

    -  ``props -set signon.security.type SSL`` means ``as400`` creates
       SSL-secured instances
    -  ``props -set signon.handler.type NONE`` means ``as400`` creates
       non-secured instances

    | The default is ``NONE``.

    | *Example*
    | 
      ``as400 -to @myas400 mysystem myuserid mypasswd # an instance     of the system is now stored in the tuple variable     @myas400``\ ````
      ``joblist -as400 @a # a joblist is     now fetched from mysystem on behalf of     myuserid.``\ ````
      ``joblist -as400 mysystem     myuserid mypasswd # fetches the joblist in the same fashion as     the previous command``
    | 
      ``as400 -- @myas400 -setaspgrp *CURUSR *SYSVAL *CURUSR # sets     to defaults, could be new values, liblist could be long     string``
    |  ``as400 -- @myas400 -disconnect``\ ````

\ ``ask``
~~~~~~~~~

    | ``/0 [-to datasink] [-from datasink] [-say ~@{prompt string}]     : get input from user``
    |  ``ask`` prompts the user (if a prompt string is provided) and
      puts the response from the user, who must press [enter] after
      entering reponse text.
    |  If the user simply presses [enter] without inputing any text, a
      zero-length string is put. If the ``-from``
      :ref:`dash-command  <Dash_Command>` is set, the prompt comes from

    -  The first line of any file datasource
    -  The string value of a tuple referenced by ``-from``

    | *Example*
    |  ``> ask -say ${ What is funny? }$``\ ````
      ``What is funny? : elephants and giraffes and     zoos``\ ````
      *``elephants and giraffes and     zoos``*
      ``> ask -to @answer -say ${ Do you have     anything to say? }$     Do you have anything to say? :     > string -len @answer     0     ``

\ ``BREAK``
~~~~~~~~~~~

    ``/0 : exit from innermost enclosing DO|FOR|WHILE     block``
     *Example*
     The following will fetch a joblist of active interactive jobs and
    look for MARSHA as a user in the job list, ``BREAK``\ ing when
    found.
     ``as400 -to @as400 mysystem myuid ********``\ ````

 ``CALL``

    ``/? @tuple ( [@parm] .. ) : Call a functor``
     The functor to be called was created by ``FUN`` and is stored in
    *@tuple*. When the functor was defined, a list of parameter names
    was provided. The substitution list of tuple names to substitute for
    the parameter names when encountered in the functor's `execution
    block <#Execution_blocks>`__ surrounded in parentheses and separated
    by at least one space but all on the same line follows.

 ``calljava``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    | ``/0 [-to @datasink] [-new ~@{classname}] [--,-obj ~@object]     [-method ~@{methodname}] [-arg ~@argobj -arg ..]] [-primarg     ~@argobj [-primarg ..]] : call Java method``

    The ``calljava`` command invokes a method or constructor in the
    underlying Java virtual machine. The object result is put to the
    assigned :ref:`datasink  <Datasinks>`. If the method has a void return
    type, nothing is put.

    The :ref:`dash-commands  <Dash_Command>` describe the desired Java
    call. Implicitly the call is a method call. If ``-new`` appears, the
    call is to a constructor.

    -  ``--,-obj ~@object`` indicates the object upon which the method
       call is to be invoked.

       -  This element is necessary in a ``-method`` call.
       -  This element is omitted when the ``-new`` dash-command is
          used.

    -  ``-new`` ``~@{classname}`` indicates the fully-decorated name of
       the class (e.g., ``java.lang.String``) for which a constructor is
       to be called.
    -  ``-method ~@{methodname}`` indicates the name of the method to be
       invoked.

       -  This element is omitted when the ``-new`` dash-command is
          used.

    -  ``-arg ~@argobj`` places an object and its class signature in the
       array to be used in method invocation.

       -  Multiple arguments are indicated by multiple usage of ``-arg``
          in left-to-right order matching the Java method specification.

    -  ``-primarg ~@argobj`` places an object and its class signature
       converted to a primitive type in the array to be used in method
       invocation.

       -  Primitive types are passed to a method call as their wrappered
          types, e.g. ``int`` is passed as ``java.lang.Integer``

          -  ``-primarg`` allows ``calljava`` to specify that the method
             signature is for the primitive, not the wrapper class.
          -  To create numbers of specific Java types to match method
             signatures, use the :ref:`num <num>` command.

       -  Multiple arguments are indicated by multiple usage of
          ``-primarg`` in left-to-right order matching the Java method
          specification.

    **Note:** The Ublu-coded extensions to Ublu in the ``extensions``
    subdirectory provide many examples of the use of ``calljava``.

    *Example*

    | ``> put -to @obj ${ this is a test     }$``\ ````
      ``> calljava -to @result -obj @obj     -method length``\ ````
      ``> put -from     @result``\ ```` ``15``\ ````
      ``> num -to @num     -int 12``\ ````
      ``> calljava -to @result -obj     @obj -method substring -primarg @num``\ ````
      ``>     put -from @result``\ ```` ``st``
    |  See also: :ref:`num <num>`

\ ``collection``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    | ``/0? [--,-collection ~@collection] [-to datasink] [-show |     -size] : manipulate collections of objects``
    |  The ``collection`` command provides support for Java collections.
      The collection (created elsewhere) is provided to the command in a
      tuple argument to the ``--`` or ``-collection``
      :ref:`dash-command  <Dash_Command>`.
    |  The operations are as follows:

    -  ``-show`` puts a string representation of the collection.
    -  ``-size`` puts the integer size of the collection.

**\ ``commandcall``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    | ``/4? [-as400 ~@as400] [-to datasink] ~@{system}     ~@{userid} ~@{passwd} ~@{commandstring} : execute a CL     command``
    |  executes a CL command represented by *commandstring* on IBM i
      system *system* on behalf of *userid* with *password*. The
      *commandstring* is a quoted string representing the entire CL
      command and its arguments. If the :ref:`-as400 <System_Userid>`
      :ref:`dash-command  <Dash_Command>` is provided, then the arguments
      ``system userid`` and ``password`` must be omitted.

    If the command results in one or more AS400 Messages, the Message
    List is ``put``.

    | Note that CL display and menu commands do not work! Also, you may
      have to juggle shell quoting to issue such command lines; it's
      definitely easier to enter this sort of thing in interpretive mode
      or as an Ublu program or function.

    *Example*

    | ``commandcall -to foo.txt somehost bluto ******** ${     SNDMSG MSG('Hello my friend') TOUSR(fjdkls) }$``
    | 
      ``# Performs a SNDMSG on SOMEHOST on behalf of user bluto     sending the text "Hello my friend" to a user FJDKLS. Any output     returned by the command is redirected to a local file     foo.txt.``
    |  ``as400``
      ``-to @myas400 somehost     bluto ******** # creates an as400 instance and stores it in     the``
      ``tuple variable     @myas400     commandcall -as400 @myas400 -to foo.txt ${ SNDMSG MSG('Hello my     friend') TOUSR(fjdkls) }$     # Performs a SNDMSG just as above using the as400 instance in     place of a repetition of credentials.``

``const``
~~~~~~~~~

    ``/2? [-to datasink] [-list | -create | -save | -restore |     -merge ] *name ~@{value} : create a constant value``

    | The ``const`` command creates a named constant with a string
      value.

    | The name of the constant must start with an asterisk character \*.

    | A constant can be used as the :ref:`argument  <Argument>` to a
      :ref:`command  <Command>` or :ref:`dash-command  <Dash_Command>` where
      the syntax notation represent the argument as ``~@{something}``
      and only in such position.

    -  Constants are not expanded within quoted strings.
    -  A constant cannot be used as the argument of a ``-from`` or
       ``-to`` dash-command where its decorated name (rather than its
       value) will itself be taken for a filename.
    -  :ref:`Plainwords  <Plainwords>` resembling constants, i.e., starting
       with an asterisk \* are not mistaken for constants.
    -  Constants defined in an interpreter level appear in its `nested
       interpreter sublevels <#Nested_interpreter_sublevel>`__.

       -  However, constants defined in nested interpreter sublevels do
          not persist into the previous interpreter level.

    The operations are as follows:

    -  ``-create`` creates constant *\*name* with string value *value*.
       It is the default operation.
    -  ``-list`` lists all defined constants to the destination
       :ref:`datasink  <Datasinks>`.
    -  ``-save`` saves the constant map to the ``-to``
       :ref:`datasink  <Datasinks>`.
    -  -``restore`` restores the constant map from the
       ``         -from`` datasink.

       -  the ``-from`` datasink must be a `tuple
          variable <#Tuple_Variables>`__ or a file.

    -  ``-merge`` merges the consts from the constant map on the
       ``-from`` datasink into the current constant map.

       -  the ``-from`` datasink must be a `tuple
          variable <#Tuple_Variables>`__ or a file.

    The ``cs`` command creates and executes a JDBC CallableStatement
    used primarily for invoking SQL stored procedures. You need an
    instance returned by the `db <db>`__ command to use ``cs``.

    The :ref:`dash-command  <Dash_Command>`\ s are as follows:

    -  ``--,-cs @cs`` references an instance created by the ``cs``
       command for subsequent operations
    -  ``-dbconnected @db`` references the database instance created by
       the `db <db>`__ command used to instance the cs object
    -  ``-new`` is the default operation and instances the cs object
    -  ``-sq1 ~@{ SQL code ... }`` provides at instancing time the SQL
       code to be executed by the cs object and puts ``true`` if the
       statement returned a result set and ``false`` if it returned
       nothing or an update count.
    -  ``-call`` executes the statement
    -  ``-in ~@{index} ~@object ~@{sqltypename}`` adds an input
       parameter to the already instanced cs object
    -  ``-innull ~@{index} ~@{sqltypename}`` adds a null input parameter
       to the already instanced cs object
    -  ``-out ~@{index} ~@{sql_type}`` declares an output parameter to
       the already instanced cs object
    -  ``-scale ~@{scale}`` is an adjunct to the declaration of certain
       input and output parameters
    -  ``-typedescription ~@{user_typename}`` is an adjunct to the
       declaration of certain input parameters, specifically those that
       reference a user-declared typename
    -  ``-rs`` puts the current result set
    -  ``-nextrs`` advances the result set counter and puts the next
       result set
    -  ``-uc`` puts the updated rows count when that is returned by the
       statement rather than a result set.

    *Example*

    ``> db -to @myDb -dbtype as400 -connect PUB400.COM     qsys2 me MYPASSWD     > cs -to @myCs -dbconnected @myDb -new -sql ${ CALL     QCMDEXC('SNDMSG MSG(''Hi there'') TOUSR(JAX)') }$     > @myCs -call     false``

    |  The ``db`` command performs a database operation on *system*'s
      *database* for *userid* with *password*.

    | Alternatively, a connected database object can be provided via the
      :ref:``-dbconnected ~@dbconnected`` `dash-command  <Dash_Command>` in
      which case the ``system     database userid password`` arguments
      must be omitted.

    | **Note:** For historic reasons, the dash-commands for this (early)
      Ublu commmand are stylistically inconsistent with the other
      commands: ``-db`` is now deprecated in favor of ``-dbtype`` and
      ``-dbconnected`` should be called ``-db``. In any case, the
      :ref:`eponymous dash-command  <Eponymous_dash-command__--_>`
      ``-- @dbconnected`` can be used instead of ``-dbconnected``

    **Note:** This command and the Ublu database code of which it is
    part is some of the oldest code in Ublu. It is being reworked
    somewhat.

    .. rubric:: Operations

    -  -``--dbtype type`` is obligatory (unless the database object is
       provided via ``---,-dbconnected       @dbconnected``) and is one
       of precisely

       -  ``as400``
       -  ``postgres``

    -  ``-charsetname charsetname`` is optional and specifically sets
       the charsetname which otherwise defaults through the
       ``-dbtype type`` to the name of an appropriate charset.
       Possibilities include any valid charset name per
       http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets/character-sets.xhtml
       such as:

       -  ``ASCII``
       -  ``CP037``

    -  ``-catalog`` fetches a catalog of *database*
    -  ``-columnnames ~@{tablename}`` creates a string list of the names
       of the columns of *tablename*.
    -  ``-columntypes ~@{tablename}`` creates a string list of the
       database-specific types of the columns of *tablename*.
    -  ``-connect`` connects to the database and puts the database for
       use with the ``--,-dbconnected`` dash-command.
    -  ``-csv`` dumps *tablename* as comma-separated values (CSV).

       -  If the dbtype is ``as400`` and the column datatype is BINARY,
          currently ASCII translation of the binary as EBCDIC character
          data is inserted intercolumnarly in the output.

    -  ``-json ~@{tablename}`` dumps *tablename* as a
       `JSON <http://json.org>`__ object.
    -  ``-disconnect`` disconnects the database object provided via
       ``--,-dbconnected @dbconnected`` invalidating all result sets
       associated with that database object.\ ````
    -  ``-metadata`` fetches a subset of database metadata
    -  ``-property`` sets JDBC connection property *k* to value *v* ...
       any number of these pairs may be set by multiple ``-property``
       dash-commands.
    -  ``-primarykeys`` fetches a result set of the primary keys for
       *tablename*.
    -  ``-query`` issues *SQL string* as an SQL query that returns one
       (1) result set.
    -  ``-query_nors`` issues *SQL string* as an SQL query that returns
       no result set.
    -  -``replicate`` reproduces (more or less, as best it can) the
       table structure of *system:database.tablename* to
       *destDbName:destDatabaseName.tablename* without copying any rows.

       -  if the ``-pklist`` dash-command is supplied, the
          space-separated list of primary keys is used in table
          generation instead of the automatic algorithmic generation of
          primary keys.
       -  use the :ref:`rs  <rs>` command to copy the rows.
       -  ``-replicate`` currently does not support alternate port
          number or adding connection properties

    -  ``-star`` is shorthand for ``-query ${ SELECT *       FROM``
       *tablename* ``}$``.

    | **Note** that table names are implicitly quoted in most ``db``
      operations and thus should be regarded as *case sensitive*.

    .. rubric:: Options

    -  ``-port`` *portnum* sets the port number for the JDBC connection
       to *portnum*
    -  -``property`` *key value* sets the connection property
       *key*\ =\ *value*

       -  Some properties have multi-word keys or values. In this case
          (or optionally in any case), specify the property key and/or
          value as a :ref:`${ quoted string }$ <Quoted_strings>`.

          -  Example: ...
             ``-property ${ translate binary }$               true -property ${ bidi string type }$ 11 -property               access ${ read call }$``
             ...

    -  -:ref:``pklist`` expects a `quoted string  <Quoted_strings>` which
       is a space-separated list of primary keys used in table
       generation instead of the automatic algorithmic generation of
       primary keys.

    | ``db`` is very much a work in progress and thus features and
      refinements will follow.

    | **Note**: As configured, ``db`` supports IBM i database and
      PostgreSQL. Support for Microsoft SQL ® is also available, if you
      care to download the JDBC driver yourself and rebuild Ublu. Follow
      the directions in the ``README.DbMSSQL.txt`` file in the directory
      ``stuff/mssql`` .

\ ``dbug``
~~~~~~~~~~

    | ``/0 [-init] [-info] [-brk ~@opname] [-clr ~@opname]     [[-step]|[-go]] [--,-dbug $[ execution block ]$] : dbug your     program``
    |  The ``dbug`` command runs a stepping program debugger on an
      execution block you provide to the command.
    |  The operations are as follows:

    -  ``--,-dbug $[ execution block ]$]`` runs the *execution block* in
       dbug mode.
    -  ``-init`` resets dbug to its default mode.

       -  single-step is off
       -  all breakpoints are cleared

    -  ``-info`` displays the current dbug internal state.
    -  ``-brk`` ``~@opname`` sets *opname* as a breakpoint.

       -  Any command or function name can be used as *opname*
       -  If *opname* is function name, provide only the name (without
          the parenthesized argument list) when setting it as a break.

    -  ``-clr ~@opname`` clears *opname* as a breakpoint.

       -  A warning is issued if *opname* was not set as a breakpoint

    -  ``-step`` sets dbug for single-step mode.
    -  ``-go`` sets ``dbug`` to run to the next breakpoint or completion
       (which ever comes first) and not single-step.

    | Before ``dbug -dbug`` ``$[ execution block     ]$]`` executes its
      *execution block*, it discards the rest of the following input.
      Commands issued after a ``dbug`` command which includes the
      ``-dbug`` ``$[     execution block ]$`` dash-command are thus
      ignored (though any other ``dbug`` dash-commands to the same
      instance of the ``dbug`` command are still parsed before execution
      of the debug block begins).

    | The :ref:`dash-commands  <Dash_Command>` controlling ``dbug``
      operations can be provided on the command line in any order. The
      debugger runs the execution block immediately after the other
      dash-commands have been processed.
    |  Issuing the ``dbug`` command does not require an execution block
      to be provided via ``--,-dbug $[ execution block     ]$``. Its
      other dash-commands may be issued at any time to set the state of
      ``dbug`` prior to actually running it on an execution block. At
      any time the state of ``dbug`` can be reset via ``-init`` .

    | When ``dbug`` gets to a breakpoint or to the break at its next
      step when single-stepping, a prompt indicating the breakpoint is
      displayed and a command line. To continue in single-step mode,
      simply press the return key.

    The valid commands at a breakpoint are as follows:

    -  ``b opname [on|off]`` sets or clears a breakpoint on *opname*

       -  The breakpoint is set if ``on`` is specified or if there is no
          third item (``on | off``) specified.
       -  The breakpoint is cleared if ``off`` is specified.

    -  ``g`` ends single-stepping and runs to the next breakpoint or to
       the end of the ``-dbug`` block.
    -  ``i`` displays info about the state of the debugger.
    -  ``q`` quits the debugger.
    -  ``t @tuplename`` examines the tuple named *@tuplename*
    -  ``x`` *command command ...* executes Ublu commands *command
       command* ... in a child interpreter instance that shares variable
       and function space and i/o with the host interpreter.
    -  Pressing the enter key causes a single-step.

    | For other debugging aids, see the :ref:`props <props>` command.

\ ``defun``
~~~~~~~~~~~

    | /``2? [[-define] | [-list] | [-show name]] name tuplename |     define a function from a name and a functor``
    |  defun takes a name and a the name of a `tuple
      variable <#Tuple_Variables>`__ which refers to a
      :ref:`functor  <Functors>` and associates the functor with the name
      in the function dictionary, thus creating a
      :ref:`function  <Functions>` findable by command lookup.
    |  The default operation is ``-define``.
    |  The operations are:

    -  ``-define`` (the default operation, this dash-command need not be
       present) defines the function *name* specfied in the arguments as
       the functor found in tuple *tuplename*.
    -  ``-list`` lists the dictionary of defined functions and their
       definitions in a code-reusable form.
    -  ``-show`` *name* shows the function definition as found by
       command lookup in a code-reusable form.

    | If the ``-list`` or ``-show name``
      :ref:`dash-command  <Dash_Command>` is present no other arguments
      should be present, and no arguments are consumed.

 ``dict``
~~~~~~~~~

    | ``/0 [-to datasink] [-from datasink] [-list | -save | -peek |     -restore | -merge] : save and restore function     dictionary``
    |  The dictionary of :ref:`functions  <Functions>` created by the
      action of :ref:`FUNC <FUNC>` and/or :ref:`defun <defun>` can
      be listed, saved, restored, or merged with the current dictionary.
    |  The default operation is to list the dictionary of functions.
    |  **Note**: Saved dictionaries are not compatible across individual
      builds of Ublu.
    |  The operations are as follows:

    -  ``-list`` lists the dictionary of defined functions and their
       definitions in a code-reusable form.
    -  ``-save`` saves the dictionary to the ``-to``
       :ref:`datasink  <Datasinks>`
    -  ``-peek`` lists the saved dictionary referenced by the ``-from``
       datasink without loading it into the current dictionary.
    -  -``restore`` restores the dictionary from the ``-from`` datasink

       -  the ``-from`` datasink must be a `tuple
          variable <#Tuple_Variables>`__ or a file.

    -  ``-merge`` merges a saved dictionary image referred to by the
       ``-from`` datasink into the current dictionary

       -  the ``-from`` datasink must be a `tuple
          variable <#Tuple_Variables>`__ or a file.

 ``DO``
~~~~~~~

    ``/5 [-undo] @iterator [to|TO] @limit $[ cmd .. ]$ : DO     iterative from @iterator to @limit exclusive of limit     incrementing/decrementing @iterator"``
     The :ref:``DO`` command iterates over a `block  <Execution_blocks>`
    reinstancing the ``@iterator`` with the current loop index
    post-incremented or post-decremented (as directed) until the
    ``@iterator`` reaches the value of ``@limit``, exclusive of the
    actual limit, or until a ``BREAK`` is encountered.
     The limit never becomes the value of the ``@iterator`` which is
    only reinstanced within the loop. Upon reaching the limit, either
    incrementing or decrementing, the loop is not executed and ends
    instead.
     The :ref:``-undo`` `dash-command  <Dash_Command>` indicates a
    decrementing, rather than incrementing loop.
     Since ``@iterator`` is reinstanced each loop, it can be examined
    inside the block. The value of the ``@iterator`` after the loop
    remains whatever it was last set to in a loop, so it can be used to
    determine what iteration a ``BREAK`` occurred on.
     The ``TO`` between tuple variable arguments to the ``DO`` command
    is optional.
     Example
     ``put -to @start 1`` ```` ``put -to @end     10`` ````
    ``DO @start @end $[ put -n -s ${ index     is }$ put -from @start test -to @break -eq @start 7 IF @break     THEN $[ put ${ leaving ... }$ BREAK ]$ ]$``

    |  The ``dpoint`` command ``put``\ s a correctly formed
      `SystemShepherd
      ® <http://www.absolute-performance.com/application-performance-management/system-shepherd-performance-monitoring/>`__
      datapoint. The datapoint can be incrementally or fully created and
      subsquently modified (when an extant datapoint is referenced via
      the :ref:``--,-dpoint`` `dash-command  <Dash_Command>`.
    |  The dash-commands that define the datapoint are as follows:

    -  ``-dup`` puts a duplicate datapoint of the datapoint provided by
       the ``--,-dpoint @dpoint`` dash-command. If no such datapoint was
       provided, an error results.
    -  ``-dkey ~@{keytext}`` defines the dkey such as
       OS\|Version\|Major.
    -  ``-addkey`` ``~@{keytext}`` appends another segment to the extant
       dkey.
    -  ``-type`` defines the type of the numeric value for the data
       value of the datapoint and/or comparison value, one of

       -  ``int``
       -  ``long``
       -  ``float``

       The default is ``int``.
    -  ``-alertlevel ~@{alertlevel}`` gives the numeric value at which
       the datapoint comparison defined by ``-comparison`` would render
       the datapoint as critical. If there is no alertlevel, no
       comparison is made and the status is OK (0). If the alertlevel is
       a ``float`` or ``long``, the ``-type`` dash command must be
       present, as ``int`` is assumed otherwise.
    -  ``-value ~@{value}`` assigns the value of the datapoint.
    -  ``-compare ~@{gt|gte|lt|lte|info|warn|crit}`` gives the
       comparison between the value and alertlevel which would render
       the datapoint as critical. If no comparison is set, no comparison
       is made.

       -  ``gt`` greater than
       -  ``gte`` greater than or equal
       -  ``lt`` less than
       -  ``lte`` less than or equal
       -  ``info`` always informational
       -  ``warn`` always warning
       -  ``crit`` always critical

    -  ``-msg ~@{msg}`` gives the message used if the datapoint is
       critical.\ ````

    |  The ``dq`` command manipulates a dataqueue on the host.
    |  If the :ref:`-as400 <System_Userid>`
      :ref:`dash-command  <Dash_Command>` is provided, then the arguments
      ``system userid`` and ``password`` must be omitted.
    |  The ``-dq`` *@dq* dash-command is used to reference an existing
      dataqueue instance previously stored in some tuple variable of the
      user's choice such as *@dq*. If the ``-dq`` dash-command is used,
      then the arguments ``dataqueuepath system userid password`` must
      be omitted.
    |  The ``dataqueuepath`` is a fully-qualified HFS path, e.g.,
      ``/qsys.lib/qgpl.lib/events.dtaq``
    |  The various operations are as follows:

    -  ``-clear`` The data queue is emptied of all messages.
    -  ``-create`` The data queue is created on the host.
    -  ``-delete`` The data queue is deleted on the host.
    -  ``-exists`` Puts ``true`` if the data queue exists on the host.
    -  ``-new,-instance`` Create a dataqueue object representing the
       data queue on the host. This object may be saved in a `tuple
       variable <#Tuple_Variables>`__ for later reference in a ``dq``
       command via the ``-dq       @dq`` dash-command. *``-instance`` is
       deprecated, use ``-new`` instead*
    -  ``-peek`` Peeks (retrieves without removing from the queue) the
       next message in the data queue putting ``null`` if the queue is
       empty.
    -  ``-query`` *factor* Queries a configuration factor of the data
       queue. The factors are:

       -  ``ccsid`` puts the codepage identifier
       -  ``description`` puts the text description
       -  ``fifo`` puts true if the queue is first in, first out
       -  ``forceauxstorage`` puts true if messages are forced to
          auxiliary storage
       -  ``maxentrylength`` puts the maximum entry length
       -  ``name`` puts the queue name
       -  ``path`` puts the HFS path
       -  ``savesender`` puts true if sender info is saved
       -  ``system`` puts the system name

    -  ``-read`` Reads, puts and removes the next entry in the queue
       putting ``null`` if the queue is empty.
    -  ``-write`` *~@${ some text }$* Writes data to the queue. This
       data should not need to be in string form, e.g., if a tuple is
       provided, but this non-string functionality is not fully tested
       yet.

    | The default operation is ``-instance`` .
    |  The full implementation of data queue support awaits the addition
      of data queue attributes and a ``dqentry`` command.

 ``eval``
~~~~~~~~~

    | ``/2/3 [-to @var] ~@[+ - * / % << >> ! & | ^     && || == > < <= >= != pct] ~@operand     [~@operand] : arithmetic``
    |  ``eval`` performs arithmetic and logical operations on
      :ref:`numbers  <Numbers>`. ``eval`` evalutes its operator and then
      exercises the operator on its one or more operands. The operator
      and all operands may each be a plain word or may be a tuple
      referencing the desired operator or operand. The result is put to
      the destination :ref:`datasink  <Datasinks>`, often a `tuple
      variable <#Tuple_Variables>`__.
    |  The operators and their operands are:

    -  ``+`` *lopr ropr* adds *lopr* to *ropr*
    -  ``-`` *lopr ropr* subracts *ropr* from *lopr*
    -  ``*`` *lopr ropr* multiplies *lopr* times *ropr*
    -  ``/`` *lopr ropr* divides *lopr* by *ropr*
    -  *``%``* *lopr ropr* is the remainder of dividing *lopr* by *ropr*
    -  ``<<`` *lopr ropr* left shifts *lopr* by *ropr*
    -  ``>>`` *lopr ropr* right shifts *lopr* by *ropr*
    -  ``!`` *opr* returns ``true`` .IFF. *opr* cannot be evaluated to
       the string ``true``,  returning ``false`` otherwise
    -  ``&`` *lopr ropr* returns the bitwise AND of its two operands.
    -  ``|`` *lopr ropr* returns the bitwise OR of its two operands.
    -  ``^`` *lopr ropr* returns the bitwise XOR of its two operands.
    -  ``&&`` *lopr ropr* returns the logical AND of testing each of its
       two operands for equality to the string ``true``
    -  ``||`` *lopr ropr* returns the logical OR of testing each of its
       two operands for equality to the string ``true``
    -  ``==`` *lopr ropr* returns ``true`` .IFF. the two operands are
       equal.
    -  ``<`` *lopr ropr* returns ``true`` .IFF. *lopr * is less than
       *ropr*
    -  ``>`` *lopr ropr* returns ``true`` .IFF. *lopr * is greate than
       *ropr*
    -  ``<=`` *lopr ropr* returns ``true`` .IFF. *lopr * is less than or
       equal to *ropr*
    -  ``>=`` *lopr ropr* returns ``true`` .IFF. *lopr * is greater than
       or equal to *ropr*
    -  ``!= ``\ *lopr ropr* returns ``true`` .IFF. *lopr * is not equal
       to *ropr*
    -  *pct lopr ropr* returns the integer (*(lopr* \* 100) / *ropr*)

    | Use :ref:`test <test>` for string comparisons.
    |  *Example*
    |  ``eval >> 0xff 4``\ ```` *``15``*

 ``exit``
~~~~~~~~~

    ``/0 [-rc ~@int] : perform System.exit()``
     Exits the Java runtime immediately, terminating all threads and
    doing no special cleanup other than that provided by the Java
    runtime itself.
     The exit will return to the host system with an exit code of 0
    unless the :ref:``-rc`` *~@int* `dash-command  <Dash_Command>` is used
    to provide an integer exit code.
     Unless you need to force exit and/or return a special exit code,
    e.g., to a calling script, use :ref:`bye <bye>` instead.

       which record format to use via the ``         -recfmt# ~@{int}``
       dash-command

       -  Alternatively, create the file first and then open it. Use
          ``-create{dds,fmt}`` to create the file whose object instance
          you have already instanced via ``-new``.

    #. Perform operations with the various dash-command
       ``-list -pos -read -write``.
    #. ``-close`` the ``file``.

    | The operations of the dash-commands are as follows:

    -  ``[-keyed | -sequential]`` one of which must be provided when
       initially instancing the ``file`` object.
    -  ``-new`` is the default operation and instances the ``file``
       object later used in an -open. ``-instance`` does not need to be
       provided to the command if no other operation is specified (other
       than ``[-keyed | -sequential]``). Of course you will wish to use
       ``-to @var`` to store the resulting object.
    -  ``-create ~@{recordLength}       ~@{fileType([*DATA|*SOURCE])} ~@{textDescription}``
       creates the file specified by ``--,-file @file`` with the
       specified attributes.
    -  ``-createdds ~@{ddsPath} ~@{textDescription}`` creates the file
       specified by ``--,-file @file`` from the DDS file specified by
       IFS path *ddsPath* with description *textDescription*.
    -  ``-createfmt ~@recFormat ~@{textDescription}`` creates the file
       specified by ``--,-file @file`` from the record format specified
       by the supplied *recFormat* object with description
       *textDescription*.
    -  ``-commitstart       ~@{lockLevel([ALL|CHANGE|STABLE])}`` starts
       commitment control on the file at the specified lock level
    -  ``-rollback`` rolls back any transactions since the last
       commit/rollback boundary.
    -  ``-commit`` commits changes to the file.
    -  ``-commitend`` ends commitment control on the file.
    -  ``-lock ~@{locktype(RX|RSR|RSW|WX|WSR|WSW)}`` locks the file with
       the specified lock

       -  ``RX`` == READ\_EXCLUSIVE\_LOCK
       -  ``RSR`` == READ\_ALLOW\_SHARED\_READ\_LOCK
       -  ``RSW`` == READ\_ALLOW\_SHARED\_WRITE\_LOCK
       -  ``WX`` == WRITE\_EXCLUSIVE\_LOCK
       -  ``WSR`` == WRITE\_ALLOW\_SHARED\_READ\_LOCK
       -  ``WSW`` == WRITE\_ALLOW\_SHARED\_WRITE\_LOCK

    -  ``-unlock`` releases the lock obtained via ``-lock``
    -  ``-open ~@{R|W|RW}`` opens the file or member

       -  ``R`` Read Only
       -  ``W`` Write Only
       -  ``RW`` Read/Write

    -  ``-getfmt`` puts a RecordFormat for the file or member. The file
       or member must already be open.
    -  ``-pos ~@{B|F|P|N|L|A}`` positions the cursor on the open member.

       -  ``B`` Before First
       -  ``F`` First
       -  ``P`` Previous
       -  ``N`` Next
       -  ``L`` Last
       -  ``A`` After Last

    -  ``-del`` deletes the file on the system. **This is
       irreversible!**
    -  ``-delmemb`` deletes the member on the system. **This is
       irreversible!**
    -  ``-delrec`` deletes the current record on the open member. **This
       is irreversible!**
    -  ``-recfmt# ~@{int}`` is optionally provided along with the
       ``-open`` to indicate which of the numbered record formats of the
       extant file or member is to be used. The default is ``0``.
    -  ``-read ~@{CURR|FIRST|LAST|NEXT|PREV|ALL}`` reads and
       :ref:`put <put>`\ s one or more records. If a single record,
       the single Record is put. If multiple records (``ALL``), an array
       of Records of an Ublu array type matching the type consumed by
       ``-writeall`` is put.

       -  ``CURR`` current
       -  ``FIRST`` first
       -  ``LAST`` last
       -  ``NEXT`` next
       -  ``PREV`` previous
       -  ``ALL`` all

    -  ``-update ~@record`` writes the record (often created via the
       :ref:`record <record>` command) to the current cursor position.
    -  ``-write ~@record`` writes the record (often created via the
       :ref:`record <record>` command) to the end of the file.
    -  ``-writeall ~@recordarray`` writes the record array to the end of
       the file.
    -  ``-setfmt ~@format`` sets the format of the file object to the
       specified RecordFormat (usually obtained via ``file -getfmt`` or
       ``record       -getfmt``)

\ ``FOR``
~~~~~~~~~

    | ``/5 @iteratorvar @valuevar $[ cmd .. ]$ : FOR``
      ``@iteratorvar (IN | in) @valuevar execute block instancing     @iteratorvar``
    |  The :ref:``FOR`` command iterates over a `block  <Execution_blocks>`
      instancing the *@iteratorvar* with the next element from the
      enumerable *@valuevar* until the enumeration is exhausted. Only
      certain object types in *@valuevar* are supported. The ``IN``
      between tuple variable arguments to the ``FOR`` command is
      optional. The list of supported types is currently:

    -  JobList (see the :ref:`joblist <joblist>` command)

       -  iterates over each job in the list

    -  ${ :ref:`quoted string  <Quoted_strings>` }$

       -  iterates over each word in the string

    -  Any iterable collection such as one created by the ``list``
       command

       -  iterates of each object in the collection

    -  ``null``

       -  No iterations will occur

    | If the value of *@valuevar* is ``null`` then no iterations will
      occur and execution will continue normally beyond the ``FOR``
      block.

    | The *@iteratorvar* name provided to a ``FOR`` command is created
      by the :ref:``FOR`` command in a more `local  <Local_variables>`
      context than the local context of any function in which the FOR
      appears, as the following session snippet illustrates:

        ``> FUNC testForItTup ( list ) $[``\ ```` ``$[) LOCAL @i`` ````
        ``$[) put -to @i       local@i``\ ````
        ``$[) FOR @i in @@list       $[``\ ````
        ``$[$[) put -from @i``\ ```` ``$[$[)  ]$``\ ````
        ``$[)  put -n -s       ${ after loop LOCAL @i is : }$ put -from @i``\ ````
        ``$[) ]$``\ ```` ``> testForItTup ( @mylist       )``\ ````
        ``list item one`` ```` ``list item two`` ````
        ``after loop LOCAL @i       is :  local@i``\ ```` ``>``
        ``       ``

    | In early versions of Ublu the *@iteratorvar* had to be declared
      explicitly and its value persisted beyond the ``FOR`` block.
      Nowadays in Ublu the ``FOR`` command instances a new more-local
      :ref:`tuple variable  <Tuple_Variables>` in a context which no longer
      exists after the FOR block.

    *Example*

    *The following will end all active jobs in the QINTER subsystem:*

    ``as400 -to @as400 MYSERVER qsecofr *******     # create an as400 instance``\ ````
    ``joblist -to     @joblist -jobtype INTERACTIVE -active -as400 @as400 # get the     filtered job list``\ ````
    ``FOR @j @joblist $[ job     -job @j -end -1 ]$ # iterate through the list and controlled     end (-1) each job``

 ``ftp``
~~~~~~~~

    | ``/3? -cd path | -cmd ${ command string }$ | -disconnect |     -get filepath | -list | -put filepath | -pwd | --,-session     @session [ -as400 ] [ -from datasink ] [ -to datasink ] [ -mode     act/pas ] [ -port portnum ] [ -type asc/bin ] [ -tofile     destfile ] ~@{system} ~@{userid} ~@{password} : FTP client with     AS400-specific extensions     ``
      The ``ftp`` command provides FTP client capability with a
      persistent session or with one-off capability. You may issue
      :ref:``ftp`` with any `dash-command  <Dash_Command>` and provide
      *system userid password* each time, or you can create and preserve
      a session to use with the various dash-commands.
    |  The main ``ftp`` dash-commands are:

    -  ``-as400`` should be used if the target system is an AS400.\ ````
    -  ``-cd`` *path* changes the current directory on the server to
       *path*.
    -  ``-cmd`` *${ command string }$* issues the `quoted
       string <#Quoted_strings>`__ as a command to the server and
       ``put``\ s the response.
    -  ``-disconnect`` disconnects the current session (usually in
       conjunction with the ``-session`` dash-command, in which case the
       -session :ref:`tuple  <Tuple_Variables>` variable is also deleted).
    -  ``-get`` *filepath* fetches *filepath* from the server.
    -  ``-list`` puts a listing of the current server directory.
    -  ``-put`` *filepath* puts local file *filepath* to the server.
    -  ``-pwd`` puts the current server directory.

    | Paths on the server should be specfied either starting with ``/``
      (absolute) or ``./`` (relative).
    |  All filenames and pathnames should be treated as case-sensitive.
    |  Destination for file transfers is by default the source filename
      in the current directory (server for ``-put``, local for
      ``-get``). Use either the ``-tofile`` *filepath* or the ``-to``
      *filepath* dash-commands to indicate a different destination (on
      the server for ``-put``, local for ``-get``).
    |  Additionally, settings are changed using the following
      dash-commands (alongside the main commands, or independently):

    -  ``-mode`` *act/pas* sets FTP Active Mode if the *act/pas* string
       is ``act`` and FTP Passive Mode if *act/pas* is ``pas``.
    -  ``-type`` *asc/bin* sets FTP ASCII Transfer Type if *asc/bin* is
       ``asc`` and FTP BinaryTransfer Type if *asc/bin* is ``bin``.
    -  ``-port`` *portnum* sets FTP port number but only before first
       connection is made, so this dash-command should usually be
       provided with the command that creates the session.

    .. rubric:: Cautions

    -  Use ``-mode pas`` for AS400 FTP sessions or they may hang
       silently.
    -  Use ``-type bin`` for all AS400 FTP transfers involving libraries
       and objects (as opposed to stream files from the Integrated File
       System (IFS)).

    .. rubric:: Persistent sessions

    | Persistent sessions are provided by the ``--,-session``
      dash-command. ``-session`` *@session* references a
      :ref:`tuple  <Tuple_Variables>` var to hold the persistent session.
      Referencing a nonexistent tuple var in conjunction with providing
      the *system userid password* arguments to the ftp command cause
      the referenced tuple var to come into existence instanced with the
      FTP session. Thereafter, the *system userid password* arguments
      are not used: instead, each time the ftp command is issued,
      accompany it with the ``-session`` *@session* reference
      established at the start, e.g.:

        ``ftp -session @mysess -port 2121 someserver myuserid       mypasswd``\ ````
        ``ftp -session @mysess -cd       someserverpath``\ ````
        ``ftp -session @mysess       -mode pas -type bin -get somefile -to       localfilepath``\ ````
        ``ftp -session @mysess       disconnect``

 ``FUN``
~~~~~~~~

    ``/6.. [-to @tuplename] ( parameter name list ) $[ an     execution block possibly spanning lines ]$ : create a     functor``
     A :ref:`functor  <Functors>` is created and put to the destination
    :ref:`datasink  <Datasinks>`, most usefully with the ``-to``
    :ref:`dash-command  <Dash_Command>` to store the new functor in
    *@tuplename*.
     When the functor is defined, a list of form parameter names is
    provided. The names are plain in the list, but if they appear
    decorated with ``@@`` (e.g., ``@@mySubstitution``) in the `execution
    block <#Execution_blocks>`__ which follows the parameter list, then
    when the functor is invoked via :ref:`CALL <CALL>` the list,
    usually tuple names (though plain words are permitted), provided to
    the ``CALL`` command will be substituted for the formal parameter
    names.
     The parameter name list is surrounded by parentheses and separated
    by one space from the parentheses.
     The execution block is surrounded by ``$[`` and ``]$`` and
    separated by one space from them.
     The entire parameter name list and opening ``$[`` bracket of the
    execution block must all appear on the same line immediately
    following the ``FUNC`` command, though otherwise the execution block
    can span multiple lines.

    -  ``-delet``\ ``e`` *name* deletes the function *name* from the
       dictionary.
    -  ``-list`` lists the dictionary of defined functions and their
       definitions in a code-reusable form.
    -  ``-show`` *name* shows the function definition as found by
       command lookup in a code-reusable form.

    | If the ``-list`` or ``-delete`` or ``-show     name``
      `dash-command <Dash_Command>`__ is present no other arguments

      plain words are permitted), provided to the function at execution
      type will be substituted for the matching formal parameter names
      as they appear in the function.
    |  The parameter name list is surrounded by parentheses and
      separated by one space from the parentheses.
    |  The execution block is surrounded by ``$[`` and ``]$`` and

    |  The ``gensh`` command generates a shell script to launch Ublu and
      call your top-level application program function with specified
      arguments provided via command-line switches as is customary with
      shell scripts.
    |  In the generated script, arguments are translated from arguments
      of user-specified shell script options to
      :ref:`tuples  <Tuple_Variables>` on the command line of the
      invocation. The specified file of Ublu functions is
      :ref:`include  <include>`\ d and the specified
      :ref:`function  <Functions>` is invoked with arguments bound to the
      translated tuple definitions.
    |  The script composed by ``gensh`` is put to the destination
      :ref:`datasink  <Datasinks>`. Typically you will write to a file via
      the :ref:``-to`` *filename* `dash-command  <Dash_Command>`.
    |  The arguments to ``gensh`` which you use to create your script
      are preserved in a comment line at the head of the script to aid
      in the recreation of the script or in the composition of similar
      scripts.
    |  The dash-commands are as follows:

    -  ``-strictPosix`` means the script will follow Posix standards for
       function declarations.
    -  ``-includepath`` may be used to set a search path for the script
       (and all modules), primarily so that gensh scripts can be used
       portably. ``$SCRIPTDIR`` is an available variable for embedding,
       and will be set to the gensh script's directory on call. Check
       for the relative include description in :ref:`include  <include>`
       for more information on how to use this.
    -  ``-opt optchar assignment_name tuplename ${ description       }$``
       creates in the generated script a ``getopts`` option that will

       help message furnished by the :ref:`quoted string  <Quoted_strings>`
       ``${ description       }$``.
    -  ``-optr optchar assignment_name tuplename ${       description }$``

       help message furnished by the :ref:`quoted string  <Quoted_strings>`
       ``${ description       }$`` and which will be **required** at
       runtime, causing the generated shell script to exit with a
       ``errno`` of ``2`` if the option is not present.
    -  ``-optx optchar assignment_name tuplename ${ description         }$``
       createsin the generated script a ``getopts`` option that will
       assign multiple *optchar*\ s' arguments cumulatively to shell
       variable ``assignment_name`` and from there to ``tuplename`` as a
       quoted string with a description in the script help message
       furnished by the :ref:`quoted string  <Quoted_strings>`
       ``${ description         }$``.

       -  If no instances of the multiple option are encountered at
          runtime, the *@tuplename* for this option will be instanced to
          null.

    -  ``-path fullyqualifiedjarpath`` sets the full path to the Ublu
       jar file. The default is ``./``\ ``ublu.jar``

    | The arguments to the command are as follows:

    -  ``~@${scriptname}`` is the name and whatever other text you care
       to see appear to the right of a first-line shell comment
    -  ``~@${includename}$`` is the name of the Ublu file of function
       definitions to include
    -  ``~@${ functionCall ( @a @b ... ) }$`` is a quoted string naming
       the function invocation to perform after the file is included
       along with the arguments. The arguments should match tuple names
       assigned via the ``-opt`` and ``-optx`` dash-commands.

    | **Note** that the option ``-h`` is reserved because ``gensh``
      automatically generates a ``-h`` option which gives a usage
      message.
    |  If the resultant script generated by gensh is invoked with the
      keyword ``silent`` before all options (e.g.,
      ``myscript.sh silent -a foo -b bar`` ... etc.) then ``include``\ d
      files do not echo and prompting is suppressed (via the inserted
      command string
      ``props     -set includes.echo false props -set prompting false``
      ).

~~~~~~~~~~

    | ``/0 [[-cmd commandname] | [-all] | [-version]] [-linelen     ~@{optional_line_length}] : display usage and help     message``

    | Displays formatted help for commands.

    With no :ref:`dash-command  <Dash_Command>`, displays a usage message
    and lists all built-in commands.

    -  ``-all`` displays help for all built-in commands.
    -  ``-cmd`` *commandname* displays help for the specific built-in
       command or the definition of a defined :ref:`function  <Functions>`
       of that name.
    -  ``-version`` displays version info for the system and its library
       dependencies.
    -  ``-linelen`` *line\_length* sets formatted line length to
       *line\_length*. The formatting applies to the help text from its
       initial indent onwards, so total line length for individual
       command help and for ``-all`` output will be greater than the
       *line\_length* value.

    Same as :ref:`usage <usage>`.

\ ``histlog``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      The ``histlog`` command retrieves, converts to a list and
      ``put``\ s the host's history log. The log is filtered by the
      :ref:`dash-commands  <Dash_Command>` specifying inclusions or
      exclusions.

    -  ``-new,-instance`` is the default operation, creating the
       HistoryLog object with defaults. *``-instance`` is deprecated,
       use ``-new`` instead*

       -  The actual history lines from the host system specified by the
          ``-as400 ~@as400`` dash-command are retrieved via the ``-get``
          dash-command.

    -  ``-close`` closes the HistoryLog specified by the ``-histlog``
       dash-command (created prior via ``-instance``).

       -  The HistoryLog should always be closed when you are done with
          it.

    -  ``-get`` puts the HistoryLog specified by the ``-histlog``
       dash-command (created prior via ``-instance``) as a list of the
       sort created by the :ref:`list <list>` command.
    -  ``-examine`` puts information about the HistoryLog object
       specified by the ``-histlog`` dash-command (created prior via
       ``-instance``), particulalry its filters.

       -  Used for debugging.

    -  ``-jobs ~@listofjobs`` filters the HistoryLog being created at
       ``-instance`` time by a list of Job objects (retrieved via
       :ref:`joblist <joblist>` and converted to a list of the sort
       created by the :ref:`list <list>` command).
    -  ``-severity`` filters the HistoryLog being created at
       ``-instance`` time for entries of the given severity or higher.
       The range is 0-99.
    -  ``-startdate`` filters the HistoryLog being created at
       ``-instance`` time for entries on or after the start date given.
    -  ``-end``\ ``date`` filters the HistoryLog being created at
       ``-instance`` time for entries on or before the end date given.
    -  ``-msgids`` filters the HistoryLog being created at ``-instance``
       time by the message ids provided in list of the sort created by
       the :ref:`list <list>` command.
    -  ``-msgidsinc omit|select`` indicates whether the ``-msgids``
       filter is inclusionary or exclusionary.
    -  ``-``\ ``msgtypes`` filters the HistoryLog being created at
       ``-instance`` time by the message types provided in list of the
       sort created by the :ref:`list <list>` command.
    -  ``-``\ ``msgtypesinc omit|select`` indicates whether the

\ ``history`` -or- ``h``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    | ``/0 [-on | -off | -onfile filename | -do linenum [-change     expr1 expr2] | -show``
      ``[-to datasink] | -head numlines |     -tail numlines | -name | -range firstline lastline]``
    |  manages history files of command lines entered into Ublu. The
      default history file name is ``./Ublu.history.ublu`` .
    |  History recording is off by default. If turned on, the history
      file will be created if it does not exist, and appended to if it
      does already exist.
    |  Ublu remembers the last history file name set, so turning on
      history recording resumes with the last file name used for
      history.
    |  When displaying history, the history display ends with the
      command line before the current one.

    -  ``-on`` turns on history recording with the current history file
       name.
    -  ``-off`` turns off history recording. The history is still
       accessible, but it does not grow.
    -  -``onfile`` *filename* turns history recording on, changing the
       history file name to *filename*.
    -  ``-do`` *linenum* repeats the commands of *linenum* in the
       history buffer.

       -  ``-change`` *expr1 expr2* will change all instances of *expr1*
          to *expr2* for the ``-do``

          -  ``-change`` is a simple string replacement, not a regex
             search.

    -  ``-head`` *numlines* displays the first *numlines* lines of the
       current history file or puts them to the ``-to`` datasink
    -  ``-name`` displays the name of the current history file or puts
       it to the ``-to`` datasink
    -  ``-range`` *firstline lastline* displays all the history between
       *firstline* and *lastline* inclusive, or puts them to the ``-to``
       datasink
    -  ``-show`` displays the entire history in the current history file
       or puts it to the ``-to`` datasink
    -  ``-tail`` *numlines* displays the first *numlines* lines of the
       current history file.

    If no operation is selected using a
    :ref:`dash-command  <Dash_Command>`, the default operation is
    ``-show``.

    | To turn history recording on in a write-protected directory, be
      sure to use the ``-onfile`` dash-command in place of the -on
      dash-command.

    Note that history can be saved in a :ref:`tuple  <Tuple_Variables>` and
    later be the subject of an :ref:`include <include>`.

    *Example:*

    ``> put ${ a a a }$     a a a     > put ${ B B B }$     B B B     > put ${ C C C }$     C C C     > history     1 put ${ a a a }$ 2 put ${ B B B     }$ 3 put ${ C C C }$     > history -show -range 1 3 -to @my_program     > put -from @my_program     put ${ a a a }$ put ${ B B B     }$ put ${ C C C }$     > include -from @my_program     :: put ${ a a a }$ a a a     :: put ${ B B B }$ B B B     :: put ${ C C C }$ C C C``

 ``host``
~~~~~~~~~

    .. rubric:: ``/3``
       ``[-to @var] [-new,-instance] [-port     ~@{portnum}] [-ssl ~@tf] [-usessl] ~@{hostname} ~@{user}     ~@{password} : instance a smapi host, default port     44444``

    | The ``host`` command creates and instance of a TCP/IP reference to
      a z/VM SMAPI host which can then be used as an argument to the
      :ref:`smapi <smapi>` command. This is analogous to the use of an
      :ref:`as400 <as400>` object to access an i Series OS server.
    |  The :ref:`dash-commands  <Dash_Command>` are as follows:

    -  ``-new,-instance`` is the default operation, instance the object
       described by the arguments. *``-instance`` is deprecated, use
       ``-new`` instead*
    -  ``-port`` is the SMAPI TCP/IP portnumber on the host.

       -  the default is ``44444``

    -  ``-ssl`` expects a tuple variable which if evaluating to true
       means "use the Secure Sockets Layer to connect to the host" ...
       otherwise, the connection does not use SSL.
    -  ``[-usessl]`` means "use the Secure Sockets Layer to connect to
       the host".

\ ``IF THEN ELSE``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    | ``/1 [-!] ~@var : IF tests boolean @var (inverted by -!)     and executes THEN $[ cmd cmd .. ]$ if true, ELSE  $[ cmd     cmd .. ]$ if false``

    | ``IF`` is a conditional execution command. ``IF`` tests the `tuple
      variable <#Tuple_Variables>`__ provided, which is usually set by
      the :ref:`test <test>` command. The variable contains the
      boolean value ``true`` or ``false``. If ``true``, the ``THEN``
      :ref:`block  <Execution_blocks>` is executed. Otherwise, the ``ELSE``
      block is executed.

    Since the value ``null`` can indicate a tuple that has been created
    but not yet set to any value, the value ``null`` causes an error
    condition when encountered by an ``IF``. Only ``true`` or ``false``
    are valid values.

    | The execution blocks of ``THEN`` and ``ELSE`` can span multiple
      lines, however:

    -  The block opener **``$[``** must immediately follow on the same
       line the ``THEN`` or ``ELSE`` command.
    -  ``THEN`` (and its **``$[``** block opener) must immediately
       follow on the same line the ``IF`` command.
    -  ``ELSE`` (and its **``$[``** block opener) must immediately
       follow on the same line the block closer **``]$``** from the
       ``THEN`` command.
    -  ``-!`` inverts the condition represented by the tuple variable to
       treat false as true and true as false.

    | *Example*
    |  ``put -to @foo ${ a }$`` ```` ``put -to @bar ${     a }$`` ````
      ``test -to @woof -eq @foo @bar`` ````
      ``IF @woof THEN $[ put ${ they are equal }$ ]$     ELSE $[ put ${ they are not equal }$ ]$     put -to @foo ${ all the beautiful horses }$     test -to @woof -jcls @foo java.lang.String     IF @woof THEN $[ put ${ tuple is indeed a java String }$ ]$     ELSE $[ put ${ tuple is not a java String }$ ]$``

 ``ifs``
~~~~~~~~

    | ``/4? [-ifs,-- ~@ifsfile] [-as400 @as400] [-to datasink]     [-tofile ~@filepath] [-from datasink] [-fromfile ~@{filepath}]     [-length ~@{length}] [-offset ~@{offset}] [-pattern     ~@{pattern}] [-b] [-t] [-create | -delete | -exists | -file |     -list | -mkdirs | -query     ~@{[ccsid|name|ownername|owneruid|path|r|w|x} | -read | -rename     ~@{/fully/qualified/path/name} | -set ~@{[ccsid|readonly]}     ~@{value} | -size | -write [~@{string }] | -writebin ]     ~@{/fully/qualified/pathname} ~@{system} ~@{user} ~@{password}     : integrated file system access``
    |  The ``ifs`` command performs operations on the OS/400 integrated
      file system, operating on files and directories equally. Use the
      :ref:``-file`` `dash-command  <Dash_Command>` to create a reference
      to the IFS object which can be stored in a `tuple
      variable <#Tuple_Variables>`__ for subsequent use with the ``-to``
      and ``-from`` dash-commands as described below. If the
      :ref:`-as400 <System_Userid>` dash-command is provided, then the
      arguments ``system     userid`` and ``password`` must be omitted.
    |  **Note:** The recommended way to pass an IFS file object already
      created to the ``ifs`` command is via the eponymous dash-command
      ``-ifs @ifsfile`` or ``--     @ifsfile`` ; the use of ``-from``
      and ``-to`` to denote the IFSFile object in the syntax noted below
      is largely historical and now deprecated.
    |  **Note** that if the ``-from datasink`` dash-command is used with
      the ``-write`` dash-command, the ``-from`` dash-command must
      appear in the command invocation *before* the ``-write``
      dash-command. The reason is that the ``-write`` dash-command will
      expect to be followed by a :ref:`quoted string  <Quoted_strings>` for
      text to write unless it has already been established that the text
      to write will come from another :ref:`datasink  <Datasinks>`.
    |  The operations specified by the dash-comands are as follows.
      ``-file`` is the default operation.

    -  ``-create`` creates on the server the IFS file specified by
       either by ``/fully/qualified/pathname`` or by the tuple variable
       referenced by the ``-from`` or a ``-ifsfile`` or ``--``
       dash-command.
    -  ``-delete`` deletes the IFS object specified by
       ``/fully/qualified/pathname`` or by the tuple variable referenced
       by the ``-from`` dash-command.
    -  ``-exists`` returns the string ``true`` if the IFS object
       specified by ``/fully/qualified/pathname`` or by the tuple
       variable referenced by the ``-from`` dash-command or a
       ``-ifsfile`` or ``--`` dash-command exists, ``false`` otherwise.
    -  ``-file`` creates a reference to the IFS object suitable for
       storage to a tuple variable via the ``-to`` *datasink*
       dash-command. This is the default operation.
    -  ``-to datasink`` sets the destination datasink to the datasink
       named by its argument. To write to a filepath whose name is
       contained in a tuple, use ``-tofile``.
    -  ``-tofile ~@{filepath}`` sets the destination datasink to the
       filepath named by its argument.
    -  ``-from datasink`` sets the source datasink to the datasink named
       by its argument. To write from a filepath whose name is contained
       in a tuple, use ``-fromfile``.
    -  ``-fromfile ~@{filepath}`` sets the source datasink to the
       filepath named by its argument.
    -  ``-length`` sets the length for a ``-read`` or ``-writebin``
       operation.

       -  defaults to the length of the file for a read and the length
          of the data source for a write

    -  ``-offset`` sets the offset for a ``-read`` or a ``-writebin``
       operation.

       -  defaults to 0

    -  ``-b`` indicates a binary file for read operation. For  binary
       writes, use ``-writebin``.
    -  ``-t`` indicates CCSID  translation should take place on a text
       file read or write.  The  CCSID is fetched from the file object.
    -  ``-list`` returns a listing of files in the IFS directory
       specifed by */fully/qualified/pathname* or by the tuple variable
       referenced by the ``-from`` dash-command or a ``-ifsfile`` or
       ``--`` dash-command assuming that *pathname* refers to a
       directory.

       -  ``-pattern ~@{pattern}`` sets the pattern (if one is desired)
          for the ``-list`` operation, e.g., ``*.*``

    -  ``-mkdirs`` creates the IFS directory specifed by
       */fully/qualified/pathname* or by the tuple variable referenced
       by the ``-from`` dash-command, including all parent directories
       if necessary.
    -  ``-query       ~@{[ccsid|name|ownername|owneruid|path|r|w|x}``
       queries and puts the file attribute specified.
    -  ``-rename ~@{/fully/qualified/path/name}$`` renames (moves) the
       file to the */fully/qualified/path/name* provided and ``put``\ s
       an IFSFile object representing the new path.
    -  ``-set ~@{[ccsid|readonly]} ~@{value}`` sets the file attribute
       specified to the value specified. The file must already exist.

       -  ``ccsid`` takes an codepage number
       -  ``readonly`` takes the string ``true``, all other values set
          the file writeable.

    -  ``-read`` reads a maximum of *length* bytes data starting at
       *offset* from */fully/qualified/pathname*.

       -  The length and offset in the target file can be set with the
          ``-length`` and ``-offset`` dash-commands. Both have defaults
          if not set.
       -  Use ``-b`` for binary files.

          -  The default is to treat a file as a text file.

    -  The file must already exist; perform a ``-create`` first if the
       file does not exist.
    -  ``-write`` writes textual data from the data source to
       */fully/qualified/pathname* (or to the IFSFile instance specified
       by the tuple variable referenced by a ``-to`` dash-command or a
       ``-ifsfile`` or ``--`` dash-command). If the ``-from``
       dash-command has been provided, the text to write comes from that
       source :ref:`datasink  <Datasinks>`.

       -  **Note** that if the ``-from datasink`` dash-command is used
          with the ``-write`` dash-command, the ``-from`` dash-command
          must appear in the command invocation *before* the ``-write``
          dash-command. The reason is that the ``-write`` dash-command
          will expect to be followed by a `quoted
          string <#Quoted_strings>`__ for text to write unless it has
          already been established that the text to write will come from
          another :ref:`datasink  <Datasinks>`.

    -  ``-writebin`` writes binary data from the source datasink to the
       IFSFile on the remote system specifed by
       */fully/qualified/pathname* or by a ``-ifsfile`` or ``--``
       dash-command.

       -  Only file and tuple datasources are suppored, and a tuple
          datasource must contain a byte array.
       -  The length and offset in the target file can be set with the
          ``-length`` and ``-offset`` dash-commands. Both have defaults
          if not set.
       -  The file will be created if it does not already exist.

\ ``interpret``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    ``/0 [-block $[ block ...]$] : run the interpreter, possibly     on a provided block     ``
    The ``interpret`` command runs a nested instance of the interpreter.
    This command can come at the end of a commandline mode operation to
    launch the interpreter. If issued in interpretive mode, stacks
    another intepreter. One layer of interpreter unnests with each
    :ref:`bye <bye>` command (Ctl-D being the same as ``bye``). All
    interpreter instances exit together when the :ref:`exit <exit>`
    command is encountered.
     An :ref:`execution block  <Execution_blocks>` can be provided via the
    :ref:``-block`` `dash-command  <Dash_Command>`. In this case, the
    interpreter instance unnests at the end of the block.
     Some state is passed back from nested interpreter sublevels to the
    previous interpreter level. See the material above on `nested
    interpreter sublevels <#Nested_interpreter_sublevel>`__.
     *Example
    * ``> interpret``\ ```` ``1>     interpret``\ ````
    ``2>     interpret``\ ```` ``3> bye`` ````
    ``2> bye``\ ``     interpret -block $[ LOCAL @foo put -to @foo ${ bar }$ tuple     -map put -from @foo ]$     @foo     bar     > tuple -map          >``
    ``1> bye``\ ```` ``>     bye``

\ ``include``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    | ``/0 or /1 [-from datasink] [-s,-silent] filepath``
    |  loads all lines from *datasink*, or, in the absence of the
      :ref:``-from`` `dash-command  <Dash_Command>`, from the file
      specified by *filepath* and interprets each line of commands as if
      they were entered interpretively. Multiple commands with their
      dash-commands and arguments can entered on a single line. Like any
      other command, if execution is successful, the system continues to
      interpret commands found after the ``include`` command. There is
      no particular limit to the length of line.

    | If any command in the included file fails, the include aborts with
      an error message and any other input which was found on the line
      which held the ``include`` command is discarded.

    | While reading the included file, each input line is echoed
      preceded by ``::`` and any command output to standard out follows
      on the next line.

    | If ``-silent`` ( ``-s``) is set, then echoing of input lines and
      prompting is suppressed until the end of the include.

    | If a file is included via the command line invocation of Ublu and
      the output is being captured and it is desirable to remove the
      input line echo, a pipe to a grep filter can eliminate the input
      lines. e.g.:

        ``java -jar ublu.jar include somefile.ublu | grep -v       '^\:\:' >output.txt``

    Inclusion of an absolute filepath is done literally as written.
    Relative paths are done with a special set of rules as follows:

    The path is similarly defined to Unix shell paths, as a
    colon-separated list (semicolon-separated is allowed for easier
    Windows compatibility, but the semicolons are automatically
    converted to colons on load). This search list lives in the
    ublu.includepath :ref:`interpreter property  <props>`, which may be
    modified at will.

    On startup, Ublu checks the ublu.includepath system property. If set
    and non-empty, the ublu.includepath interpreter property is copied
    from it.

    On startup, Ublu checks the UBLU\_INCLUDEPATH environment variable.
    If set and non-empty, the ublu.includepath interpreter property is
    copied from it (or appended to it, if the property is already set at
    this point).

    When include is called with a relative path, each element of the
    ublu.includepath property will be searched for the file in order
    until one is found (eg. if ``include foo/bar.ublu`` is called, and
    the ublu.includepath property is ``/A:/B:.``, the include will be
    searched in order as /A/foo/bar.ublu, /B/foo/bar.ublu, and
    ./foo/bar.ublu).

    If the file was not found in the search path, the file will be
    attempted to be located relative to the including file's location
    (eg. if ``include foo/bar.ublu`` is called from /path/to/baz.ublu,
    /path/to/foo/bar.ublu will be tried).

    If the file could not be found anywhere, a FileNotFoundException
    will be raised and the command fails.

 ``jmx``
~~~~~~~~

    | ``/0 [-from datasink] [-to datasink] [--,-jmx @jmx_instance]     [-obj @obj_instance] [-protocol ~@rmi|iop|?] [-host     ~@hostname|hostip] [-port ~@portnum] [-url ~@/remainder_of_url]     [-role ~@${ rolename }$ ] [-password ~@${ password }$]     [-connect | -close | -new,-instance | -get ~@${}domain     ~@${}type ~@${}name | -attrib ~@${ attribute }$ | -attribs ~@${     attrib attrib ... }$ | -cdi ~@attribute | -datakey ~@attribute     ~@key | -mbeaninfo |-query [ names | mbeans | class classname]]     : perform JMX access to a JVM``
    |  The ``jmx`` command provides JMX access to a JVM, either remote
      or local, which has been started with java command line switches
      allowing such access, e.g., via a java invocation such as:

        ``java -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=9999       \``\ ````
        ``-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false       \``\ ````
        ``-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false -jar       /opt/ublu/ublu.jar``

    | If the :ref:``-jmx @jmx`` `dash-command  <Dash_Command>` with an
      instanced :ref:`tuple variable  <Tuple_Variables>` is provided the
      ``-host     -port -protocol`` and ``-url`` dash-commands are
      ignored.
    |  Certain dash-commands require also a JMX ObjectInstance (fetched
      prior via the ``jmx -get`` dash-command). This ObjectInstance is
      passed to the ``jmx`` command in an instanced tuple variable via
      the ``-obj @obj_instance`` dash-command.
    |  The operations are as follows:

    -  ``-new,-instance`` is the default operation, creating and
       ``put``\ ting a ``JMXHelper`` instance based on the following
       specifications:

       -  ``-protocol ~@rmi|iop|?`` is the transport protocol
          (defaulting to ``rmi``)\ ````
       -  ``-host ~@hostname|hostip`` is the (nominally remote) host on
          which the JVM to connect to resides\ ````
       -  ``-port ~@portnum`` is the port on which JMX is listening on
          behalf of the target JVM\ ````
       -  ``-url ~@/remainder_of_url`` is the trailing portion of the
          JMX connection url defaulting to ``/jmxrmi``
       -  The instance created by ``-instance`` is not yet connected.
          *``-instance`` is deprecated, use ``-new`` instead*

    -  ``-connect`` connects the extant ``JMXHelper`` specified by the
       ``-jmx @jmx`` dash-command

       -  ``-role ~@${ rolename }$`` is used only with -connect and sets
          the role for authentication and determines that password
          authentication will be used in the connection attempt.

          -  If ``-role`` is not used with ``-connect`` then connection
             with no authentication will be attempted.

       -  ``-password ~@${ password }$`` is used only with ``-connect``
          and sets the password for authentication.

          -  If ``-role`` is not present with ``-connect`` then
             ``-password`` has no effect.

    -  ``-close`` closes the connection to the the extant ``JMXHelper``
       specified by the ``-jmx @jmx`` dash-command.

       -  Once closed, a connection cannot be re-opened and a new
          instance must be created.

    -  ``-get ~@${}domain ~@${}type ~@${}name put``\ s a JMX
       ``ObjectInstance`` specified by the dash-command's arguments as
       follows: Given a specification like
       ``java.lang:MemoryPool:Tenured Gen`` then

       -  ``java.lang`` is the ``domain``
       -  ``MemoryPool`` is the ``type``
       -  ``Tenured Gen`` is the ``name``

    -  ``-cdi ~@attribute`` applies to a JMX ObjectInstance's attribute
       which must be a CompositeDataInstance, ``put``\ ting the raw
       CompositeDataInstance.

       -  This is useful for examining the CDI interactively.

    -  ``-attrib ~@${ attribute }$`` requires an ``ObjectInstance`` be
       provided by the ``-obj       ~@obj_instance`` dash-command and
       ``put``\ s the value of one attribute. 
    -  ``-``\ ``attribs`` ``~@${ attrib attrib ...         }$`` requires
       an ``ObjectInstance`` be provided by the ``-obj ~@obj_instance``
       dash-command and ``put``\ s a list of attributes and their values
       based on the string specification of attributes to seek.

       -  Missing attributes come back as nulls in the list.

    -  ``-datakey ~@attribute ~@key`` requires an ``ObjectInstance`` be
       provided by the ``-obj       ~@obj_instance`` dash-command and
       ``put``\ s the value of one data item of the JMX CompositeData
       attribute represented by *~@attribute* and reference by *~@key* .
    -  ``-mbeaninfo`` provides complete info on an ``ObjectInstance``
       provided by the ``-obj       ~@obj_instance`` dash-command
    -  ``-query [names | mbeans | class classname]`` returns:

       -  ``names`` : a list of JMX ``ObjectNames`` from the connected
          MBeanServer
       -  ``mbeans`` : a list of JMX ``ObjectInstances`` from the
          connected MBeanServer
       -  ``class classname`` : a list of JMX ``ObjectInstances`` which
          are members of the Java class *classname* from the connected
          MBeanServer

    | *Example*
    |  To launch a JVM with JMX without authentication running Ublu :

        ``java -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=9999       \``\ ````
        ``          -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false       \``\ ````
        ``          -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false \``\ ````
        ``    -jar       /opt/ublu/ublu.jar``\ ````

    | To launch a JVM with JMX with plaintext role/password
      authentication running Ublu :

        ``    -jar           /opt/ublu/ublu.jar``

    ``pfile.txt`` must be ``chmod 600`` or ``chmod 400`` and should be
    (if JRE properties are the installed defaults) of the form:
        ``monitorRole s0m3pa55w0rd``\ ```` ``controlRole n0th3rpa55wd``

    Then from anywhere (another machine or the same machine) use Ublu

      arguments ``system userid`` and ``password`` must be omitted.
    |  Job objects for use with the ``job`` command are typically
      obtained via the :ref:`joblist <joblist>` command, e.g.,

    | **Use caution when using the ``-end`` dash-command with any value
      other than -1 for a controlled end to the job!** Any other
      argument to ``-end`` can possibly leave the system in need of a
      reboot.
    |  The operations are as follows:

    -  ``-``\ ``as400`` ``@as400`` instances the job on the system
       represented by the @as400 variable. See the
       :ref:`as400 <as400>` command.
    -  ``-end`` ends the job with a delay for ending processing of
       delaytime.

       -  -1 means controlled end to the job. This is *always*
          preferable from a system administrative point of view.
       -  -0 means immediate end to the job. This is a *last resort* and
          is dangerous
       -  Any other value means that number of seconds of delay to end
          processing in an orderly fashion, after which the job is ended
          immediately.
       -  **Use caution when using the ``-end`` dash-command with any
          value other than -1 for a controlled end to the job!** Any
          other argument to ``-end`` can possibly leave the system in
          need of a reboot.

    -  ``-get`` ``job_property`` puts a string for the job property
       specified. Currently supported are:

       -  ``name``
       -  ``number``
       -  ``subsystem``
       -  ``user``
       -  ``description``
       -  ``type``

    -  ``-hold ~@tf_holdspooledfiles`` holds the job. If
       *holdspooledfiles* is ``true``, the job's spooled files are held.
    -  ``-info`` provides information on the job
    -  ``-new,-instance`` puts a Job object as described by the other
       arguments to the command. *``-instance`` is deprecated, use
       ``-new`` instead*
    -  ``-job @job`` is used to provide an extant instance of a Job to
       the command, or to provide at tuple variable in which to store an
       instance.

       -  When the ``-instance`` dash-command is provided, ``@job`` will
          be instanced with the job instance created.

          -  In this case, ``@job`` must *not* be an already instanced
             tuple variable.

       -  Alternatively, the ``-to`` dash-command can be used to put the
          job object to a tuple variable. This is probably simpler that
          using the ``-job`` dash-command.

    -  ``-noop`` does nothing.
    -  ``-query`` queries *property* of the job putting the resultant
       object. Currently, the following properties are supported in
       queries:

    -  ``AUTOSTART``
    -  ``BATCH``
    -  ``INTERACTIVE``
    -  ``SUBSYSTEM_MONITOR``
    -  ``SPOOLED_READER``
    -  ``SYSTEM``
    -  ``SPOOLED_WRITER``
    -  ``SCPF_SYSTEM``
    -  ``ALL``

    | The jobtype filter defaults to ALL in the absence of the
      ``-jobtype`` dash-command.

    | The ``-active`` dash-command filters for only those jobs which are
      active.
    |  The ``-disconnected`` dash-command appears only in conjunction
      with the ``-active`` dash-command and, if present, filters for
      only those active jobs which are disconnected.

    *Example*

    *The following will end all active jobs in the QINTER subsystem:*

    | ``as400 -to @as400 mybox qsecofr ******* # create an as400     instance``\ ````
      ``joblist -to @joblist -jobtype     INTERACTIVE -active -as400 @as400 # get the filtered job     list``\ ````
      ``FOR @j @joblist $[ job -job @j -end     -1 ]$ # iterate through the list and controlled end (-1) each     job``

       -  1303 Coded character set identifier (CCSID) for data
       -  1304 CCSID conversion status indicator for data

    -  ``-clear`` clears all attributes (including defaults) for the
       list of message attributes to receive.
    -  ``-close`` closes the connection to the joblog referenced by
       ``--,-joblog ~@joblog``
    -  ``-dir ~@tf`` sets the list direction. ``true`` sorts
       oldest-to-newest, ``false`` sorts newest-to-oldest. The default
       is true.
    -  ``-length`` puts the length of the message list associated with
       the job log referenced by ``--,-joblog       ~@joblog``
    -  ``-new ~@{jobname} ~@{jobuser} ~@{jobnumber}`` puts a connected
       joblog instance for the job referenced by *jobname* *jobuser*
       *jobnumber*
    -  ``-qm ~@{offset} ~@{number}`` puts a list of *number* queued
       messages starting at at offset *offset* in the queued messages
       for the joblog referenced by ``--,-joblog ~@joblog``

       -  *offset* must be > -1 and <= the remaining length of the list.
          Use ``-length`` to calculate these arguments.
       -  See the :ref:`msg <msg>` command for processing the
          individual messages in the list.

    -  ``-query ~@{dir|name|user|number|sys}`` queries the joblog
       referenced by ``--,-joblog ~@joblog``. The queries are:

       -  ``dir`` puts the list direction, ``true`` means
          oldest-to-newest, ``false`` means newest-to-oldest.
       -  ``name`` puts the job name
       -  ``user`` puts the job user
       -  ``number`` puts the job number
       -  ``sys`` puts the host system

    -  ``-write ~@{message_id}         ~@{COMPLETION|DIAGNOSTIC|INFORMATIONAL|ESCAPE}``
       writes a message to the job log of the Ublu job if running native
       on the host and ``-onthread`` is ``true``. The message is written
       to the joblog of QZRCSRVS otherwise.

       -  ``-msgfile ~@{/full/ifs/path/}`` optionally specifies message
          file on the host to use for ``-write``
       -  ``-onthread ~@tf`` if ``true`` specifies that a message from
          ``-write`` by an Ublu job running native on the host goes to
          the Ublu job's log, to the joblog of QZRCSRVS otherwise. If
          not explicitly set, ``true`` is assumed.
       -  ``-subst ~@{message_substitution}`` optionally specifies
          message substitution text for ``-write``.

      Of course the output of the ``-get`` operation can be put to the
      desired :ref:`datasink  <Datasinks>` via the ``-to`` dash-command.
    |  The operations and options are as follows:

    -  ``-lib ~@{libname}`` specifies the library containing the journal

       helper.
    -  ``-journal ~@{journal}`` specifies the journal in OFS form. It
       only is specified while instancing the journal helper.

    The ``json`` command creates and unpacks `JSON <http://json.org/>`__
    interchange format.

    The operations are as follows:

    -  ``-add ~@object`` appends the JSON object to the JSON array
       provided via the ``--,-json ~@json``

       array provided via the ``--,-json       ~@json`` dash-command.
    -  ``-key ~@{key}`` puts the object named *key* of the JSON object
       provided via the ``--,-json ~@json`` dash-command.
    -  ``-keys`` puts an iterable list of keys for the JSON object
       provided via the ``--,-json ~@json`` dash-command.
    -  ``-length`` puts the number of entries for the JSON array
       provided via the ``--,-json ~@json`` dash-command.
    -  ``-list`` puts the JSON array provided via the
       ``--,-json ~@json`` dash-command as an iterable list such as that
       returned by the :ref:`list <list>` command.
    -  ``-object`` puts a new JSON object. If the data source is STD: an
       empty object is created. Otherwise, an object is created based on
       the contents of the data source provided via the ``-from``
       dash-command.

    |  The system maintains a Last In, First Out tuple stack. ``lifo``
      operates on this stack. Many of the operations are upon the top of
      stack (TOS) item.
    |  Except for ``-true`` ``-false`` and ``-null``, ``lifo`` can push
      only extant tuples to the tuple stack. To automatically wrapper a
      non-tuple item in an anonymous tuple and push that tuple to the
      tuple stack, use ``put -to ~ item``.
    |  The operations are:

    -  ``-push @tuplevar`` pushes ``@tuplevar`` which becomes TOS
    -  ``-pop`` removes TOS and puts it to the destination
       :ref:`datasink  <Datasinks>`.
    -  ``-popval`` removes TOS and puts it value to the destination

    -  ``-swap`` swaps the top two items on the stack
    -  ``-over`` pushes a copy of the 2nd item on the stack
    -  ``-pick ~@{0index}`` pushes a copy of the *0index*\ th item on
       the stack
    -  ``-rot`` removes the 3rd item on the stack and pushes it to the
       stack
    -  ``-depth`` puts the depth of the stack
    -  ``-clear`` removes all items from the stack
    -  ``-drop`` removes TOS
    -  ``-show`` shows the entries on the stack. This is the default
       operation
    -  ``-true`` pushes ``true`` to the stack.
    -  ``-false`` pushes ``false`` to the stack.
    -  ``-null`` pushes ``null`` to the stack.

       collection or space-separated items from a string (in the latter
       case, no blank space being preserved). If the source is a Java
       primitive array, it must be an array of Object ( ``Object []`` ).
    -  ``-add ~@object`` postpends *object* to the list.
    -  ``-addstr ~@${ some string }$`` postpends *some string* to the

 ``LOCAL``
~~~~~~~~~~

    | ``/1 @localvar : declare local variable``
    |  :ref:``LOCAL`` declares `tuple variables  <Tuple_Variables>` local
      to a :ref:`block  <Execution_blocks>`. Any variable declared this way
      hides any global variable of the same name. Any variable declared
      this way hides any variable of the same name which is local to a
      block enclosing the current block. This declaration neither
      replaces nor alters any variable of the same name which is local
      to the current block.
    |  A ``LOCAL`` variable disappears at the end of the current block,
      unhiding any enclosing ``LOCAL`` declarations or a global
      declaration.
    |  Declaring a ``LOCAL`` outside a block generates an error.
    |  ``LOCAL`` variables can be used as arguments to functions called
      from within the ``LOCAL``-declaring block, but they cannot be used
      as arguments passed to other threads (see :ref:`thread  <thread>` and
      :ref:`TASK  <TASK>`). The ``LOCAL`` variable does not exist in the
      context of the new thread.

      :ref:`dash-command  <Dash_Command>` must be present. The operations

    -  ``-key`` puts the byte array message key
    -  ``-fromjob`` puts the sending job

    The ``msgq`` command sends, retrieves, removes or replies messages
    from the message queue instance represented by the message queue
    object supplied to the ``-msgq`` dash-command  or in *system*'s
    queue *fullyqualifiedifspath* on behalf of *userid* with *password*.
    Output is to standard out unless the ``-to``
    :ref:`dash-command  <Dash_Command>` is present to specify a filename or

    omitted. If the ``-msgq`` dash-command is provided, then the
    arguments *system fullyqualifiedifspath userid* and *password* must
    be omitted.

    It is recommended that you use ``-close`` to close the message queue
    when you are done with it.

    .. rubric:: Reading messsages

    | Selectors may be applied to the message retrieval. They are
      processed in the order read on the command line and complement or
      override each other as read sequentially. The default is ``-all``.
      If any selector other than ``-all`` is chosen, only that selector
      and any other specified selectors are included.

    -  ``-all`` means all messages, which is the default in the absence
       of any selector dash-command.
    -  ``-new,-instance`` puts the specified message queue object to the
       destination :ref:`datasink  <Datasinks>`, usually a tuple variable,
       later to be supplied to the ``-msgq`` dash-command to reference
       this message queue. *``-instance`` is deprecated, use ``-new``
       instead*
    -  ``-close`` closes the message queue whose instance is provided
       via the ``--,-msgq`` dash-command.
    -  ``-none`` means all selectors are cleared, and in the absence of
       any further selector dash-commands will result in no messages
       being retrieved.
    -  ``-query`` means fetch all selected messages.
    -  ``-reply`` means messages needing a reply are included.
    -  ``-noreply`` means messages not needing a reply are included.
    -  ``-copyreply`` means copy messages that need a reply are
       included.
    -  ``-remove`` removes the message referenced by *messagekey*

       -  the message key can be retrieved using the :ref:`msg <msg>`
          command

    -  ``-removeall`` removes all messages in the queue
    -  ``-``\ ``sendinfo`` sends informational *message text* to the
       queue.
    -  ``-sendinquiry`` sends an inquiry message consisting of *message
       text* and the queue to reply to *replyqueueIFSpath* to the queue.

    .. rubric:: Replying to an inquiry message

    -  ``-sendreply messagekey`` ``~@{reply text}`` where the message
       key is the hexadecimal number returned in the "``Key:``\ " field
       of the message queue data return by the ``msgq`` command and the
       text provided in a tuple or quoted string is the reply to the
       message. When this dash-command is used, none of the selectors
       noted above for reading messages apply.
    -  ``-sendreplybinkey`` ``~@bytearraykey ~@{reply       text}``
       where the message key is the ``byte []`` array returned by
       ``msg -- @msg       -key`` operation on the individual message
       fetched from the message queue and the text provided in a tuple
       or quoted string is the reply to the message. When this
       dash-command is used, none of the selectors noted above for
       reading messages apply.

    |  If the ``-from @qnamevar`` or ``-from qnamefile`` dash-command is
      provided, the queue name comes from the String in the tuple
      variable or the first line of the file, respectively. In either
      case, omit the queue name argument.
    |  The default operation ( represented by the ``-instance``
      dash-command) is to put the OutputQueue object to the destination
      :ref:`datasink  <Datasinks>`, so the ``-to`` ``@varname``
      dash-command can be used to store the object to a t\ `uple
      variable <#Tuple_Variables>`__ for later re-use with the ``-outq``
      dash-command.
    |  The supported operations represented by the dash-commands are as
      follows:

    -  ``-clear [[user jobuser]`` ``| [form         formtype] | all]``

       -  clears the output queue of jobs for user *jobuser*, or from
          forms of *formtype*, or of all (the default) jobs.

          -  ``outq -outq @q -clear user FRED``
             ``#               clears the queue of FRED's jobs``\ ``.``

    -  ``-get ~@attribute`` puts the value of the named attribute to the
       destination datasink. `Appendix A: Printer
       Attributes <#Appendix_A>`__ lists the attributes that can be
       queried.
    -  The following three operations get attributes of the output queue
       by selector. These attributes are represented by integer
       selectors whose values are described (deep) in the JTOpen
       documentation. The attribute selectors are defined for your
       convenience as constants in ``extensions/ux.printobj.ublu``.

       -  ``-getfloat ~@{attr_int}`` puts the float value of the
          attribute represented by *attr\_int* of the output queue
          represented by the ``--,-outq           ~@outqueue`` dash
          command.
       -  ``-getint ~@{attr_int}`` puts the integer value of the
          attribute represented by *attr\_int* of the output queue
          represented by the ``--,-outq           ~@outqueue`` dash
          command.
       -  ``-getstring ~@{attr_int}`` puts the string value of the
          attribute represented by *attr\_int* of the output queue
          represented by the ``--,-outq           ~@outqueue`` dash
          command.

    -  ``-hold``

       -  Holds the queue

    -  ``-new,-instance``

       -  Puts the output queue instance to the destination datasink.
          This can be used to store the instance for re-use by
          ``-outq @q`` for the ``outq`` or ``spoolf`` commands.  Same as
          ``-info``.

       *``-instance`` is deprecated, use ``-new`` instead*
    -  ``-noop``

       -  Does nothing, not even instance the ``-to`` tuple var

    -  ``-release``

       -  Releases the queue

    |  The ``printer`` command allows you to instance a printer and get
      or set printer attributes. If the :ref:`-as400 <System_Userid>`
      :ref:`dash-command  <Dash_Command>` is provided, then the arguments
      ``system userid`` and ``password`` must be omitted.
    |  If instead the printer is specified by the ``-printer``
      *~@{printer*} dash-command, then the
      ``printername     system user`` and ``password`` arguments must be
      omitted, as well as the ``-as400 @as400`` dash-command.
    |  The operations are as follows:

    -  ``-new,-instance`` puts a printer object to the destination
       :ref:`datasink  <Datasinks>`. If standard out, this is a way to
       display a large number of the printer attributes, including
       several which cannot be set with this command (due to limitations
       of JTOpen). *``-instance`` is deprecated, use ``-new`` instead*
    -  ``-get ~@attribute`` puts the value of the named attribute to the
       destination datasink. `Appendix A: Printer
       Attributes <#Appendix_A>`__ lists the attributes that can be
       queried.
    -  The following three operations get attributes of the output queue
       by selector. These attributes are represented by integer
       selectors whose values are described (deep) in the JTOpen
       documentation. The attribute selectors are defined for your
       convenience as constants in ``extensions/ux.printobj.ublu``.

       -  ``-getfloat ~@{attr_int}`` puts the float value of the

          represented by the ``--,-printer           ~@printer`` dash
          command.
       -  ``-getint ~@{attr_int}`` puts the integer value of the
          attribute represented by *attr\_int* of the output queue
          represented by the ``--,-outq           ~@printer`` dash
          command.
       -  ``-getstring ~@{attr_int}`` puts the string value of the
          attribute represented by *attr\_int* of the output queue
          represented by the ``--,-outq           ~@printer`` dash
          command.

    -  ``-set ~@attribute value`` sets the named attribute to the string
       or integer value provided. The user must provide the correct type
       of data for the attribute or an error will result. The attributes
       which the underlying `JTOpen <http://jt400.sourceforge.net/>`__
       library allows to be set are as follows:

       -  ``CHANGES`` The time at which pending changes take effect.
          Valid values are \*NORDYF, \*FILEEND, or blank which implies
          no changes pending to the writer.
       -  ``DRWRSEP`` Identifies the drawer from which the job and file
          separator pages are to be taken. Valid values are -1, -2, 1,
          2, 3. The value \*FILE is encoded as -1, and the value \*DEVD
          is encoded as -2.
       -  ``FILESEP`` The number of file separator pages that are placed
          at the beginning of each copy of the spooled file. Valid
          values are -1, or the number of separators. The value \*FILE
          is encoded as -1.
       -  ``FORMTYPE`` The type of form to be loaded in the printer to
          print this spooled file.
       -  ``OUTPUT_QUEUE`` The Integrated File System path of the output
          queue. The format of the Integrated File System path is
          "/QSYS.LIB/library.LIB/queue.OUTQ" where *library* is the
          library that contains the output queue and *queue* is the name
          of the output queue.
       -  ``DESCRIPTION`` Text to describe the instance.

    -  :ref:``-wtrjob`` puts the printer's writer `job  <job>`.

    *Example
    * ``>as400 -to @s mybox myname     mypwd``\ ````
    ``>printer -to @p -as400 @s     SOME_LPR``\ ````

    |  The ``programcall`` command invokes a program to run on the
      server and ``put``\ s an object representing the result of the
      call.
    |  To  use ``programcall`` you must understand precisely the program
      you are invoking, its input and output parameters.
    |  In specifying parameters, they are added to the array of
      parameters to be passed to the program in the order you specify
      them to the command. Any number used by the program can be
      specified and they are added to the array as you specify them.
    |  When a variable type is called for, that value is one of:

    -  ``DEC``
    -  ``CHAR``
    -  ``LGL``
    -  ``INT``
    -  ``UINT``
    -  ``PTR``

    | The :ref:`dash-commands  <Dash_Command>` are as follows:

    -  ``-to datasink`` if present controls where the return parameter
       array is ``put``.
    -  ``-program fullyqualifiedprogrampath`` is the IFS pathname of the
       program, e.g ``/QSYS.LIB/QGPL.LIB/MYPROG.PGM``
    -  ``-in ~@tuple ~@{vartypename}`` adds an ``IN`` parameter in order
       to the parameter list to be passed to the program. The ``tuple``
       contains the value and ``vartypename`` is the i OS program type
       of the variable, one of the list specified above.
    -  ``-inout ~@tuple ~@{sizeout} ~@{vartypename}`` adds an ``INOUT``
       parmeter in order to the parameter list to be passed to the
       program. The ``tuple`` contains the value. ``sizeout`` is the
       length of the parameter. ``vartypename`` is the i OS program type
       of the variable, one of the list specified above.
    -  ``-out ~@tuple ~@{sizeout} ~@{vartypename}`` adds an ``OUT``
       parmeter in order to the parameter list to be passed to the
       program. The ``tuple`` contains the value. ``sizeout`` is the
       length of the parameter. ``vartypename`` is the i OS program type
       of the variable, one of the list specified above.
    -  ``-msgopt ~@{all|none|10}`` specifies how many messages will be
       accepted returned from the program call. The choices are  ``all``
       , ``none`` , or ``10`` for a maximum of 10. Any other value
       generates an error.

    | Other properties can be set and retrieved arbitrarily for program
      usage.
    |  Properties can be loaded from a file or written out to a file at
      any time. Users may thus save properties files and load them on
      the command line at invocation to control the behavior of the
      interpreter.
    |  The operations are as follows:

    -  ``-set ~@${ name }$ ~@${ value }$`` property *name* is set to
       *value*
    -  ``-get ~@${ name }$`` the value of property *name* is ``put``
    -  ``-list`` all properties are ``put``
    -  ``-read ~@${filepath}$`` properties are read in from the
       Java-style properties file *filepath*
    -  ``-write ~@${filepath}$ ~@${comment}$`` all properties are
       written to the Java-style properties file *filepath* with the
       header comment *comment*

    |  The ``put`` command puts data from the source
      :ref:`datasink  <Datasinks>` ( Standard Input ( called ``STD:`` ),
      filename, :ref:`*@variable*  <Tuple_Variables>`, the `Tuple
      stack <#Tuple_stack>`__ signified by ``~``, or ``NULL:`` )
      specified by the :ref:``-from`` `dash-command  <Dash_Command>` to the
      destination datasink ( Standard Output ( called ``STD:`` ),
      filename, *:ref:`@variable  <Tuple_Variables>`*, the `Tuple
      stack <#Tuple_stack>`__ signified by ``~``, or ``NULL:`` )
      specified by the ``-to`` dash-command, optionally translating
      charset if ``-toascii`` or ``-charset`` are set.
    |  In the absence of ``-to`` and/or ``-from`` (or -``tofile`` and/or
      ``-fromfile``) the respective datasinks are by default Standard
      Input and Standard Output.
    |  The :ref:``-tofile`` dash-command takes a `tuple  <Tuple_Variables>`
      name or a tuple from the :ref:`tuple stack  <Tuple_stack>` and uses
      its string value as a filename to set the destination datasink.
    |  The ``-fromfile`` dash-command takes a tuple name or a tuple from
      the tuple stack and uses its string value as a filename to set the
      source datasink.
    |  If the data is from the command line (STD:), it can be a `quoted
      string <#Quoted_strings>`__ , an object in a tuple either named
      inline (``@sometuple``) or residing on the tuple stack  ( ``~`` ),
      or a single lex ( a single word). In this case its most simple
      string value is what is put to the destination datasink.

    -  If the -from dash-command is present and the source datasink is a
       tuple (e.g., ``-from @myobj``), ``put`` renders the object in a
       helpful matter rather than merely printing its most simple string
       value.
    -  If neither the ``-from`` nor the ``-fromfile`` dash-command is
       present, Standard Input is the source datasink and put emits the
       string value of one of the following:

       -  a single lex (a plain word)
       -  a ``${ quoted string }$``
       -  a tuple object or string
       -  the ``~`` character indicating the target of the put is popped
          from the tuple stack

    -  If the destination datasink is the tuple stack ( ``~`` ) and the
       source object is not in tuple form, the source object is wrapped
       in an anonymous tuple and pushed to the tuple stack.
    -  If the ``-#`` *number* dash-command is present, put parses
       *number* as a signed number and puts it to the destination
       datasink.
    -  If the ``-append`` dash-command is present, if the output
       datasink is a file or a tuple holding a string and the object to
       put is a string, the string is appended to the extant data in the
       file or tuple.
    -  If the ``-toascii`` dash-command is present, it is assumed the
       source charset in CP037 and character translation to ASCII is
       performed.
    -  If the ``-charset`` *srccharsetname* dash-command is present
       character translation is performed from *srccharsetname* to
       ASCII.
    -  If the ``-n`` dash-command is present, a string put to standard
       output is *not* followed by a new line; otherwise, it is followed
       by a newline.
    -  If the ``-s`` dash-command is present, a string put to standard
       output is followed by a blank space.

    | *Example
      * The following example uses the :ref:`file <file>` command to
      fetch info about the members of an i Series OS record file into a
      tuple @ml then first does a ``put @ml`` then a ``put -from @ml``
      illustrating the difference between the two semantics of ``put``.

    |  The ``record`` command manipulates records in classic record
      files operated on by the :ref:`file <file>` command.
    |  The record itself is either retrieved via ``file -read`` or
      created via ``record -instance``.
    |  Once instanced, the record is reference via the ``--`` or
      ``-record`` dash-command.
    |  The :ref:`dash-command  <Dash_Command>` operations are as follows:

    -  ``-new`` instances a new record. This is the default.
    -  ``-getfmt`` fetches the record format of the record
    -  ``-getcontents`` puts the contents of the record as a byte array.
    -  ``-getfield ~@{index}`` puts the object from *index*\ th field of
       the record.
    -  ``-getfields`` puts an object array of all fields' contents of
       the record.
    -  ``-getfieldbyname ~@{fieldname}``\ puts the object from the field
       named *fieldname* of the record.
    -  ``-setfmt ~@format`` sets the format of the record to given
       format (typically retrieved via ``record       -getfmt`` or
       ``file -getfmt``).
    -  ``-setcontents ~@{contents}`` sets the contents of the record to
       the byte array provided.
    -  ``-setfield ~@{index} ~@object`` sets the (zero-based) indexed
       field of the record to the object provided.
    -  ``-setfieldbyname ~@{fieldname} ~@object`` sets the field with
       the given name to the object provided.
    -  ``-tostring`` returns the record as a string.

    The ``rs`` command operates on result sets.

    -  ``-abs ~@{row}`` moves the result set cursor to the given
       one-based index. If negative, the cursor moves to an absolute row
       position from the end of the result set. Zero (0) is before the
       first row, -1 is the last. Puts true if the cursor is still
       within the result set, false if beyond either end.
    -  ``-rel ~@{rows}`` moves the result set cursor forward (positive)
       or backward (negative) the given number of rows. Puts true if the
       cursor is still within the result set, false if beyond either
       end.
    -  ``-next`` moves the result set cursor ahead one row. Puts true if
       the cursor is still within the result set, false if beyond either
       end.
    -  ``-get ~@{index}`` puts the object found at the one-based index
       of the current row.
    -  ``-lget ~@{label}`` puts the object found at the labelled column
       of the current row.
    -  ``-bytes ~@{index}`` puts a byte array of the bytes found at the
       one-based index of the current row.
    -  ``-autocommit 0|1``

       -  Both of the result sets reference by the ``-to`` and ``-from``
          :ref:`tuples  <Tuple_Variables>` have their autocommit mode set

          -  0 means "no autocommit"
          -  1 (or any non-zero value) means "yes autocommit"
          -  It is not an error for one or both of the result set tuples
             not to be set, or not to reference a result set. An
             informational message is written to stderr in this case.

    -  The ``-close{|db|st}`` dash-commands close the result set and/or
       the originating statement and/or the database connection.

       -  If the target result set is provided via
          ``--           @tuplename`` then there should be *no*
          ``@tuplename`` argument to the ``-close{|db|st}`` dash-command
          itself.
       -  If the target result set is *not* provided via
          ``-- @tuplename`` then there *should be* a ``@tuplename``
          argument to the ``-close{|db|st}`` dash-command itself.

       -  ``-close``

          -  The result set referenced by *tuplename* is closed.

       -  ``-closedb``

          -  The result set referenced by *tuplename* is closed, the
             originating statement is closed and the underlying database
             instance is disconnected.

       -  ``-closest``

          -  The result set referenced by *tuplename* is closed and the
             originating statement is closed.

    -  ``-commit @tuplename``

       -  The result set referenced by *tuplename* is committed.

          -  Only valid if autocommit is set off.

    -  ``-fetchsize numrows``

       -  Both of the result sets reference by the ``-to`` and ``-from``
          tuples have their fetch size set. An informational message as
          to the current fetch size is written to stderr.

          -  If numrows is zero (0), only the informational message is
             written and no change to the fetchsize occurs.
          -  It is not an error for one or both of the result set tuples
             not to be set, or not to reference a result set. An
             informational message is written to stderr in this case.

    -  ``-getblob ~@{index}`` puts the Blob at column index *index* as a
       binary stream to the destination datasink.
    -  ``-lgetblob ~@{label}`` puts the Blob at column name *label* as a
       binary stream to the destination datasink.
    -  ``-insert``

       -  The rows of the source result set are inserted in the
          destination table represented by the destination result set.

          -  This operation should fail if keys are unique and any key
             from the source result set already exists in the
             destination result set.
          -  If any mandatory columns exist in the table represented by
             the destination result set which are not present in the
             source result set, those extra, mandatory columns should
             all appear in the destination result set query, ordinally
             after the rows which the source and destination have in
             common. The copy from the source to the destination is by
             column ordinal in the two result sets. The copy will not
             care if the destination has extra rows compared to the
             source, but the insert *will* fail if mandatory columns are
             omitted from the destination result set row that is being
             inserted.

    -  ``-json ~@db ~@{tablename}`` puts the result set specified by the
       ``--,-rs ~@rs`` dash-command as `JSON <http://json.org>`__ text.
       *db* represents the :ref:`db <db>` instance which produced the
       result set, and *tablename* is the name of table from which the
       result set came.
    -  ``-metadata`` returns the source (``-from``) result set metadata.
    -  ``-split``

       -  accepts a *split\_specification* that indicates

          -  the one's-based index of one (1) character or binary column
             of the source table which is to be split into multiple
             columns
          -  the number of division into which it is to be split
          -  the width of each split

       The *split\_specification* is of the form
       *column\_number\_to\_split number\_of\_splits split\_width\_1
       split\_width\_2* ... etc.
    -  ``-toascii``

       -  Introduces an array of column indexes for columns assumed to
          be textual data which should undergo character conversion from
          EBCDIC to ASCII. *numindices* is the count of indices to
          follow and each *index* is the 1's-based column index for a
          column to undergo character conversion from EBCDIC to ASCII.

    *Examples
    *

    | Inserting the source result set into the destination result set

 ``savesys``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

    ``/0 [-to datasink] [-from datasink] [-merge] [-save |     -restore] : save and restore compiled code``

    The ``savesys`` command saves your compiled Ublu code to a file
    which can subsequently be restored, but only to the exact same level
    of the Ublu system. The :ref:`dash commands  <Dash_Command>` are as
    follows:

    -  ``-save`` saves the system to the destination data sink specified
       by ``-to datasink``. Currently this can only be a file datasink.
    -  ``-restore`` restores the system from the source data sink
       specified by ``-from datasink``. Currently this can only be a
       file datasink.
    -  ``-merge`` indicates that the restore should merge the restored
       system with the extant compiled code. Any definition which exists
       in the saved system will overwrite a definition of the same name
       in the current system. Without the ``-merge`` dash command, the
       saved system overwrites the current system.

\ ``server``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

    | ``/0 [-to datasink] [-- @listener] [-port ~@{portnum}] [[     -block ~@{executionBlock} | $[execution block]$ ] | -getport |     -start | -status | -stop ] : start, stop or monitor status of a     thread server``
    |  Starts, stops, or displays status of a TCP/IP listener over
      *portnum* (defaulting to port 43860) which spawns server threads.
      The server threads spawned by the listener either will:

    -  serve up an Ublu interpreter that accepts input and executes
       commands, or
    -  serve up an Ublu interpreter interpreting an `execution
       block <#Execution_blocks>`__ provided to the command and exits
       when than block is complete.

    | Whichever is chosen, all server threads spawned by one instance do
      the same thing.

    | When executed without any :ref:`dashcommand  <Dash_Command>`, the
      default action is ``-status``.

    -  ``-port ~@{portnum}`` sets the port on which the ``-start``
       operation will start the listener.
    -  ``-block ~@{executionBlock} | $[execution block]$`` specifies the
       Ublu code for the server spawned by the listener to execute when
       a connection is made.
    -  ``-start``; creates and starts and instance of the listener and
       puts the listener to the destination :ref:`datasink  <Datasinks>`
       for use later in referencing this server instance.
    -  ``-stop`` sets a flag for the listener to end at the next listen
       timeout. The instance of the listener is provided via the
       ``-- @listener`` dash-command.
    -  ``-getport`` returns the port number the instance provided via
       the ``--`` ``@listener`` dash-command is running on.
    -  ``-status`` displays a brief message on the status of the
       instance provided via the ``--`` ``@listener`` dash-command.

    | **There is currently no security paradigm. Using the server grants
      any caller without authentication the full rights of the user who
      launched Ublu.
      ** The safe(st) way (available) to use the server is to write a
      :ref:`FUNC <FUNC>` to service the user and call that ``FUNC`` in
      a block provided with the ``-block $[execution block]$``
      dash-command.

    |  The session command manipulates a tn5250 session object provided
      by the :ref:`tn5250 <tn5250>` command. The ``-sess @sess``
      :ref:`dash-command  <Dash_Command>` must always be present.
    |  The operations are as follows:

    -  ``-? ~@${question}$`` queries the session with *question* and
       puts the answer to the destination :ref:`datasink  <Datasinks>` .

       -  The following questions are supported:

          -  ``connected`` returns true .iff. the session is connected.

    -  ``-close`` closes the session, which, if last session,
       resultantly closes tn5250j which calls ``System.exit()``
    -  ``-disconnect`` disconnects the session, leaving it open.
    -  ``-getcursor`` puts the current cursor position as a
       ``java.awt.Point`` to the destination datasink.
    -  ``-setcursor`` sets the cursor position to *x y*
    -  ``-dump`` puts a character screen dump (e.g., for screen
       scraping) to the destination datasink.
    -  ``-send`` transmits to the session a string including string
       representations for metakeys such as [tab] [enter] etc.

       -  If the ``-from`` dash-command is provided, the source datasink
          is the source for the string.

          -  If the source datasink is a file, the first line of the
             file is the source for the string.

       -  Otherwise, the :ref:`tuple  <tuple>` , `popped
          tuple <#Tuple_stack>:ref:`__ , `quoted string  <Quoted_strings>`
          or :ref:`plain word  <Plain_words>` following the ``-send`` is
          the source.
       -  If the ``-from`` dash-command is provided, no symbol or string
          should follow ``-send`` though other dash-commands and
          commands can follow.

    -  ``-nt`` prevents the system from trimming blank space at the head
       and tail of any ``-send`` string.

``sleep``
~~~~~~~~~

    ``/0 [-m ~@{milliseconds}] [-n ~@{nanoseconds}] Sleep     milliseconds (default 0) plus nanoseconds (default 0)``
     The sleep command sleeps for milliseconds plus nanoseconds. The
    default for both values, if not set via the
    ``-m     ~@{milliseconds}`` and -``n ~@{nanoseconds}``
    :ref:`dash-commands  <Dash_Command>` is zero (0).

\ ``smapi``
~~~~~~~~~~~

    ``/2? [-to @var] ~@host ~@{funcname} [~@{parm} [~{@parm} ..]]     : make a smapi call to a host``
     The ``smapi`` command uses the provided
    `PigIron <http://pigiron.sourceforge.net/>`__ library to execute a
    `z/VM ®
    SMAPI <https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSB27U_6.3.0/com.ibm.zvm.v630.dmse6/toc.htm>`__
    function on the :ref:`host  <host>` designated by ``~@host`` .
     The easiest way to make SMAPI calls is to use the functions mapped
    one-to-one to the supported PigIron SMAPI calls in the ``.ublu``
    files found in the directory ``examples/pigiron`` and included *en
    masse* by the file ``all_pigiron.ublu`` found in that directory.
    These functions instance a PigIron output parameter array in the
    final argument ``@paramarray`` with the returns from SMAPI.
     Examples of testing are found in ``examples/pigiron/test/`` ...
    Copy ``test.defaults.samp`` to a filename of your choice (say,
    ``my.test.defaults``), edit the values for your target system, and
    execute the shell script ``test_pigiron.sh -f     my.test.defaults``

    |  The ``sock`` command creates and manipulate TCP/IP sockets.
      Instancing the socket connects it. You can then read, write,
      examine, and close the socket. Operations are as follows:

    -  ``-host ~@{host_or_ip_addr}`` sets the target host when
       instancing
    -  ``-port ~@{portnum}`` sets the target port when instancing
    -  ``-locaddr ~@{local_addr}`` optionally sets the local address to
       use (multihomed systems)
    -  ``-locport ~@{local_portnum}`` optionally sets the outgoing port
       to use
    -  ``-new`` creates and connects the socket. This is the default
       operation
    -  ``-close`` closes the socked provided via ``--,-sock ~@sock``
    -  ``-avail`` puts the number of bytes estimate available for a read
       operation
    -  ``-read ~@{count}`` reads a byte array of up to ``count`` bytes
    -  ``-write ~@bytes`` writes the bytes in the byte array ``bytes``

      ``        ``
    |  The ``spoolf`` command operates on an individual spooled file
      object. You can create the spooled file object directly from a
      full specification as shown above, or you can use the ``-spoolf``
      :ref:`dash-command  <Dash_Command>` to provide a tuple referencing a
      spooled file object either created directly or obtained via the
      :ref:`spoolflist <spoolflist>` command.

    -  If the ``-as400`` dash-command is used to reference the host
       system, the specifications for the target system must not appear
       in the command statement.
    -  If the ``-spoolf`` dash-command is used to reference an extant
       spooled file object, none of the specifications for the spooled
       file can appear in the command statement, nor may the ``-as400``
       dash-command appear.
    -  The ``-tofile`` *@filename* dash-command allows providing a
       filename in a :ref:`tuple variable  <Tuple_Variables>` so that the
       ``-fetch`` operation (see below) can be used to iterate over a
       filelist.

    | The various operations are as follows:

    -  ``-answermsg ~@${ some text }$`` answers *some text* to a message
       which the referenced spooled file is waiting on.
    -  ``-copy`` copies the referenced spooled file to the same queue.
    -  ``-copyto @remote_as400`` copies the spooled file to the queue of
       userid used in creating the remote AS400 instance
       *@remote\_as400* .
    -  ``-copyq ~@outq`` copies the referenced spooled file to the
       referenced *outq*.

       -  Obtain the *outq* via the :ref:`outq <outq>` command.

    -  ``-create`` creates and writes a new spooled file from data
       provided by the ``-from @data`` dash-command. **Note** that
       ``-create`` does no ASCII/EBCDIC translation.

       -  ``-outq``  (optional)  is the associated output queue object
       -  ``-ppl`` (optional) is the associated print parameter list
          object
       -  ``-printerfile`` (optional) is the associated printer file
          object

    -  ``-delete`` deletes the referenced spooled file.
    -  ``-fetch`` fetches the referenced spooled file as a transformed
       text file.

       -  this is equivalent to the :ref:`fetch <fetch>` command.

    -  ``-get`` *info* puts a string representing the requested *info*.
       The following *info* about a spoolfile is available:

       -  ``createdate``
       -  ``createtime``
       -  ``jobname``
       -  ``jobnumber``
       -  ``jobsysname``
       -  ``jobuser``
       -  ``message``
       -  ``name``
       -  ``number``

    -  ``-hold [-immed|-pageend]`` holds the referenced spooled file in
       the queue, either immediately (the default) or at page end ( if
       the -``pageend`` dash-command is also provided).
    -  ``-new,-instance`` instances the spooled file described by the
       arguments to the command and puts it to the destination
       :ref:`datasink  <Datasinks>`. *``-instance`` is deprecated, use
       ``-new`` instead*
    -  ``-move ~@spoolf_before_me`` moves the referenced spooled file to
       a position immediately after *spoolf\_before\_me*.

       -  The two spooled files may be on the same queue or on different
          queues, but they must both be on the same system.

    -  ``-moveq ~@${outq_on_same_system}$`` moves the referenced spooled
       file to first position on another queue on the same system.
    -  ``-release`` releases the (ostensibly held) referenced spooled
       file.
    -  ``-sendtcp ~@remotesysname ~@remoteprintqueuepath`` transmits the
       referenced spooled file to another system via TCP shared
       printing. *Untested
       *
    -  ``-top`` moves the referenced spooled file to the top of its
       current queue.

    |  The ``string`` command performs string operations and
      :ref:`put  <put>`\ s the result to the destination
      :ref:`datasink  <Datasinks>`. Its operands are provided with the
      individual :ref:`dash-commands  <Dash_Command>` specifiying the
      operation. Any and all string operands may be

    -  :ref:`plain word  <Plain_words>`, as in ``thisword``
    -  :ref:`quoted string  <Quoted_strings>`, as in
       ``${       these words here }$``
    -  :ref:`tuple  <Tuple_Variables>`, as in ``@mystringtuple``
    -  :ref:`stack tuple  <Tuple_stack>`, signified by ``~`` (tilde)

    If the `eponymous dash-command <Eponymous_dash-command__--_>`__
    ``[--,-string ~@{lopr}]`` is present, it takes the place of the sole
    or left operand of the dash-command denoting the operation. This
    only applies to sole or left operands which have a string value and
    does not apply to the dash-commands which operate on byte array
    arguments.

    | The operations are:

    -  ``-bl`` ``~@${string}`` appends a blank space to *string* and
       puts the result to the destination :ref:`datasink  <Datasinks>`.
    -  ``-bls`` ``~@{string} n`` appends *n* blank spaces to *string*
       and puts the result.
    -  ``-cat ~@{string1} ~@{string2}`` concatenates *string1* with
       *string2* and puts the result. No space is inserted between the
       two strings by this command.
    -  ``-eq ~@{string1} ~@{string2}`` puts ``true`` if *string1* equals
       *string2*, ``false`` otherwise.
    -  ``-frombytes ~@byte_array`` puts a string built from the char
       values of the bytes in *byte\_array*\ ``.``
    -  ``-len ~@{string}`` puts the length of *string* to the
       destination datasink.
    -  ``-new`` puts a new empty string to the destination datasink.
    -  ``-nl`` ``~@{string}`` appends a newline to *string* and puts the
       result to the destination datasink.
    -  ``-repl ~@{string}`` ``~@{target}       ~@{replacement}`` puts
       the string resulting from the replacement of all occurences of
       *target* with *replacement.*
    -  ``-repl1 ~@{string} ~@{target} ~@{replacement}`` puts the string
       resulting from the replacement of the first occurence of *target*
       with *replacement*.
    -  ``-replregx ~@{string} ~@{regex} ~@{replacement}`` puts the
       string resulting from the replacement of all occurences of
       *regex* with *replacement*.
    -  ``-startswith ~@{string} ~@{substr}`` puts ``true`` if *string*
       starts with *substr*, ``false`` otherwise.
    -  ``-substr ~@{string} ~@intoffset ~@intlen`` puts an *intlen*
       substring of *string* starting from the zero-base *intoffset.*
    -  ``-toas400 ~@as400 ~@{string} ~@{ccsid}`` converts *string* to a
       byte array encoded according to *ccsid* fetching the conversion
       table from system *as400*. If *ccsid* is -1, the default ccsid of
       user profile associated with *as400* is used.
    -  ``-toascii ~@as400 ~@bytes ~@{ccsid}`` converts a byte array
       *bytes* encoded according to *ccsid* to a string, fetching the
       conversion table from system *as400*. If *ccsid* is -1, the
       default ccsid of user profile associated with *as400* is used.
    -  ``-tobytes ~@{string}`` puts a byte array of the bytes from
       *string*.
    -  ``-trim`` ``~@{string}`` puts *string* with the leading and
       trailing whitespace removed.
    -  ``-uchar ~@{ 0x????  0x???? ...}`` puts a string consisting of
       the unicode character(s) for the hex value(s) provided. The

      the system via arguments or via ``-as400     @as400`` and the IFS
      path to the subsystem description via
      ``-subsyspath ~@{subsysIFSpath}``. Store the resultant object in a
      :ref:`tuple variable  <Tuple_Variables>` and use it with the
      -:ref:``subsys ~@subsys`` `dash-command  <Dash_Command>` to perform
      operations on the subsystem.
    |  If the :ref:`-as400 <as400>` dash-command is provided, then the
      arguments ``system userid`` and ``password`` must be omitted.

      :ref:`-as400 <as400>` dash-command and the arguments
      ``system userid`` and ``password`` must be omitted.
    |  The operations are as follows:

    -  ``-assignshared ~@{sequencenumber} ~@{poolname}`` assigns the
       shared system pool designated by *poolname* to the subsystem with
       *sequencenumber* as its sequence number.
    -  ``-assignprivate``
       ``~@{sequencenumber} ~@{size}       ~@{activityLevel}`` defines a
       private storage pool of size *size* and activity level
       *activitylevel* and assigns it to sequence number
       *sequencenumber*.
    -  ``-change``
       ``[description ~@{text} | displayfile       ~@{path} | languagelibrary ~@{lib}} | maxactivejobs       ~@${int}]``
       changes the designated subsystem attribute to the provided value.
    -  ``-create`` creates the specified subsystem description on the
       system.

       -  If ``-authoritystring ~@{authoritystring}`` has been
          specified, the description is created granting the specified
          authority (e.g., ``*LIBCRTAUT)`` to users who do not have
          specific authority for the object, who are not on an
          authorization list, and whose group profile or supplemental
          group profiles do not have specific authority for the object.

    -  ``-delete`` deletes the specified subsystem description on the
       system.
    -  ``-end`` shuts down the specified subsystem description on the
       system designated by *as400*. Be careful!

       -  If ``-timelimit ~@{intval}`` has been specified, the shutdown
          is controlled with the specified time limit in seconds. The
          special value -1 means "no time limit".
       -  If ``-timelimit ~@{intval}`` has *not* been specified, the
          shutdown is immediate.

    -  ``-endall`` shuts down all subsystems on the designated by
       *as400*. Be careful!

       -  If ``-timelimit ~@{intval}`` has been specified, the shutdown
          is controlled with the specified time limit in seconds. The
          special value -1 means "no time limit".
       -  If ``-timelimit ~@{intval}`` has *not* been specified, the
          shutdown is immediate.

    -  ``-new,-instance`` is the default operation, instancing the
       subsystem object for Ublu use. *``-instance`` is deprecated, use
       ``-new`` instead*
    -  ``-list`` lists all subsystems.
    -  ``-query [description | activejobs | displayfilepath |         languagelibrary | library | maxactivejobs | monitorjob |         name | objectdescription | path | pool | pools         ~@{sequencenumber}``
       queries the specified attribute and puts an appropriate object.

       -  The query ``pools`` requires a sequence number.

    -  ``-refresh`` refreshes the data for the subsystem from the host.
    -  ``-remove ~@{sequencenumber}`` removes the storage pool
       designated by *sequencenumber*.
    -  ``-start`` starts the specified subsystem.

\ ``SWITCH``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

    | `` ~@stringselector [-case ~@${string}$ $[ block ]$     [[-case ~@${string}$ $[ block ]$] ...] [-default $[ block ]$] :     language switch statement``\ ````
    |  ``SWITCH`` provided with a string selector proceeds to walk thru
      a series of :ref:``-case`` `dash-commands  <Dash_Command>` looking
      for a match. If the match is found, the `execution
      block <#Execution_blocks>`__ referenced by the ``-case`` is
      executed.
    |  Each ``-case`` is accompanied by a case string and a block. If
      the case string matches the selector, the case is taken, its block
      is executed, and no other ``-case`` or ``-default`` will be taken.
    |  Each ``-default`` is accompanied only by a block.  If a
      ``-default`` dash-command is encountered before a ``-case``
      matches, the ``-default`` is executed and no following ``-case``
      will match.
    |  The ``-case`` dash-commands and the ``-default``, if any, can be
      in any order and are processed in the order they appear. The
      ``-default`` once encountered is always taken if no match has been
      found prior and no other ``-case`` or ``-default`` will be taken.
    |  Nothing prevents one ``-case`` dash-command from having the same
      case string as another ``-case`` .
    |  ``SWITCH`` is only easy to use inside another block (e.g, in a
      :ref:`FUNC <FUNC>`) because a block is parsed as single line,
      allowing the ``-case`` dash-commands to appear on individual
      lines, indented. Interactively entered, all the ``-case``
      dash-commands must appear on one line.

\ ``system``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

    ``/1 [-to datasink] [-from datasink] | ~@{ system command } :     execute a system command``
     executes a system command
     The command string can be provided as a `quoted
    string <#Quoted_strings>:ref:`__, `tuple variable  <Tuple_Variables>`,
    pop from the :ref:`tuple stack  <Tuple_stack>`, or from a file if so
    indicated by the :ref:``-from`` `dash-command  <Dash_Command>`.
     If input is from a file, only the first line of the file is read.
     The output of the command is displayed or put to a
    :ref:`datasink  <Datasinks>` specified by the -to dash-command. If the
    destination datasink is standard out (``STD:``), an extra line is
    put indicating the return code of the command execution
     ``system`` is only good for one-time commands, not interactive
    programs such as telnet.

    |  The sysval command gets and sets system values. When instancing,
      an :ref:`as400 <as400>` instance must be provided via the
      :ref:``-as400`` `dash-command  <Dash_Command>`. Thereafter the
      instance is passed to ``sysval`` for the other operations via the
      ``-sysval`` dash-command.
    |  There is no default operation. The operations are as follows:

    -  ``-new,-instance`` *groupid* creates a system value list instance
       for the group of system values represent by *groupid*.
       *``-instance`` is deprecated, use ``-new`` instead*

       -  ``all`` is the easiest to use.

    -  ``-haskey ~@{ key }`` puts ``true`` .IFF. there exists in the
       list a system value represented by *key*, otherwise ``false``.
    -  ``-value`` ``~@{ key }`` puts the object for the system value
       represented by *key*.
    -  ``-set ~@{ key } ~@value`` sets the system value represented by
       *key* to the object *value*.
    -  ``-systemvalue`` puts the SystemValueList object itself (for
       debugging).
    -  ``-list`` puts a list of the SystemValue objects.
    -  ``-map`` puts a map of the keys this SystemValueHelper contains.

    *Example*

\ ``TASK``
~~~~~~~~~~

    ``/1? [-from datasink] [-to datasink] [-start] $[ BLOCK TO     EXECUTE ]$ : create a background thread to execute a block,     putting the thread and starting the thread if specified     ``
    The ``TASK`` command creates a thread to execute a block and
    optionally launches the thread immediately. ``TASK`` ``put``\ s the
    thread object it creates, which can be stored in the destination
    :ref:`datasink  <Datasinks>` via the ``-to``
    :ref:`dash-command  <Dash_Command>` for later manipulation by the
    ``thread`` command which can start and stop the thread.
     Instead of providing a block as an argument to the ``TASK``
    command, you may provide a series of commands stored as a string in
    a file or :ref:`tuple variable  <Tuple_Variables>` indicated as the
    source datasink via the ``-from`` dash-command.
     The new thread inherits the current tuple variable space but will
    not possess new entries added to other threads subsequent to the
    launch of this ``TASK``'s thread.
     The new thread starts with the system dictionary. Any additional
    functions must be added by include or ``dict`` ``-restore``.
     The ``-start`` dash-command starts the thread immediately. The
    default is to simply put the thread to be later started via the
    ``thread`` command.

\ ``test``
~~~~~~~~~~

    | ``/0 [-to @var] [[[-eq | -ne] @var|lex @var|lex] | [-null     @var ] | | [-nnull @var ] [-jcls @var full.javaclass.name]]:     compare and return boolean result``
    |  ``test`` performs object and string tests and comparisons. It can
      be used to set a :ref:`tuple variable  <Tuple_Variables>` for use by
      conditionals such as the ``IF`` command or to put the result to
      default :ref:`datasink  <Datasinks>`.
    |  Each of the two objects of the following binary tests

    -  ``-eq`` (equality)
    -  ``-ne`` (inequality)

    | are either the value of a ``@tuplevar`` or a single lex (single
      word). The following test will return true:

        ``put -to @foo 7``\ ```` ``test -eq 7       @foo``

    | The other tests are unary and their object is always a
      ``@tuplevar``.
    |  The operations known to ``test`` each return ``true`` if the test
      succeeds, ``false`` otherwise, and are as follows:

    -  ``-eq`` tests two values for strict Java equality.
    -  ``-jcls`` test the value of a tuple variable for Java class type.
    -  ``-ne`` negates the value of a test of the two values for strict
       Java equality.
    -  ``-null`` tests the value of a tuple variable for ``null``.
    -  -``nnull`` tests the value of a tuple variable for ``not``
       ``null``.

    | If the operands to ``-test`` are Strings, the Strings are first
      ``trim``\ med of leading and trailing whitespace.

    | ``test`` is primarily for string and object comparison. Use
      :ref:`eval <eval>` for arithmetic and logical operations.

    To test for the existence of a tuple variable, use ``tuple -exists``
    *@varname*

    See the ``IF``  and ``DO`` commands for examples.

\ ``thread``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

    | ``/0 [-from datasink] [-to datasink ] [--,-thread ~@thread]     -new,-instance | -start | -stop : interpret in a background     thread``
    |  The thread command creates and/or manipulates threads of
      execution.  When the thread command instances a thread, it
      ``put``\ s the thread object it creates, which can be stored in
      the destination :ref:`datasink  <Datasinks>` via the ``-to``
      :ref:`dash-command  <Dash_Command>` for later manipulation. The
      thread command can also manipulate threads created by the
      :ref:`TASK <TASK>` command.
    |  The operations are as follows:

    -  ``-new,-instance`` creates and puts a new thread. *``-instance``
       is deprecated, use ``-new`` instead*

       -  The program for the thread to execute is an `execution
          block <#Execution_blocks>`__ found in the source
          :ref:`datasink  <Datasinks>` referenced by the ``-from``
          dash-command.
       -  The thread is not started and must be started by another
          invocation of the ``thread`` command with the ``-start``
          dash-command.

    -  ``-start`` starts the thread referenced by the ``-thread``
       *@thread* dash-command.

       -  The thread referenced by the ``-thread`` *@thread*
          dash-command can be one created by the thread command or one
          created by the :ref:`TASK <TASK>` command.

    -  ``-stop`` stops the thread referenced by the ``-thread``
       *@thread* dash-command.

       -  The thread referenced by the ``-thread`` *@thread*
          dash-command can be one created by the thread command or one
          created by the :ref:`TASK <TASK>` command.
       -  The thread which is stopped cannot be restarted.

    | The thread object will display information about itself if ``put``
      to standard output.

 ``THROW``
~~~~~~~~~~

    ``/1  ~@{log string} : THROW from a TRY block``
     ``THROW`` creates an error condition and a log message.
     The error condition will cause exit from a :ref:`TRY <TRY>` block
    and entry to the ``CATCH`` block.
     If there is no enclosing ``TRY`` block the ``THROW`` will return to
    the interpreter and the error condition will be reported by the
    interpreter.
     *Example*
     ``FUNC testTry ( ) $[``\ ```` ``    TRY $[``\ ````
    ``        put ${ outer try     block }$``\ ````
    ``            TRY $[``\ ````

    |     
    |  `tn5250j <http://tn5250j.sourceforge.net/>`__ is an open source
      terminal emulator coded in Java for 5250 display terminal emulator
      over TCP/IP. This command creates and manipulates instances of
      tn5250j.
    |  If the :ref:``-tn5250 @tn5250`` `dash-command  <Dash_Command>` is
      provided, the :ref:``~@system`` `argument  <Argument>` must be
      omitted. Some operations require the ``-tn5250 @tn5250``
      dash-command.
    |  **Note** that at present, when a running tn5250j instance exits,
      it calls System.exit() shutting down AbsPerfOS400.
    |  The operations are as follows:

    -  ``-new,-instance`` puts a tn5250j instance to the destination
       :ref:`datasink  <Datasinks>`. *``-instance`` is deprecated, use
       ``-new`` instead*
    -  ``-my5250`` runs an instance of tn5250j in a thread without
       preserving the instanced object for manipulation.
    -  ``-run`` runs the tn5250j instance referenced by the
       ``-tn5250 @tn5250`` dash-command
    -  ``-session`` puts the initial tn5250 session instance to the
       destination datasink, usually a tuple so that it can be
       manipulated via the :ref:`session  <session>` command.

       -  A tn5250j instance can have multiple sessions. At present this
          command only supports the initial session.
       -  This command presumes the ``-tn5250 @tn5250`` dash-command

    -  ``-sessionlist`` returns a list of sessions in the tn5250j
       instance

       -  A tn5250j instance can have multiple sessions. At present this
          command only supports the initial session.
       -  This command presumes the ``-tn5250 @tn5250`` dash-command  

``trace``
~~~~~~~~~

    ``/0   [-tofile ~@{filename}] [-on] [-off] [-set     ~@{all|conversion|datastream|diagnostic|error|info|jdbc|pcml|proxy|thread|warning}     ~@{on|off}]: set JTOpen tracing``

    The ``trace`` command controls JTOpen tracing. Diagnostic info is
    streamed to standard out or to a file, as controlled by various
    means including JTOpen properties files. A full discussion of the
    configuration and usage of JTOpen tracing is beyond the scope of
    this document. Consult the JTOpen javadocs for
    com.ibm.as400.access.Trace ... currently com.ibm.jtopenlite.Trace is
    not supported by Ublu.

    -  ``-on`` activates tracing if any category of tracing has been
       abled either through JTOpen properties or via the ``trace -set``
       command.
    -  ``-off`` deactivates tracing.
    -  ``-tofile ~@{filename}`` sends trace data to the specified
       *filename*.
    -  ``-set       ~@{all|conversion|datastream|diagnostic|error|info|jdbc|pcml|proxy|thread|warning}       ~@{on|off}``
       adds to the tracing stream or removes the specificed category of
       tracing data.

    | The category settings persist until explicitly changed by the
      ``trace`` command even when tracing is deactivated by ``-off``.

    | *Example
      *
      ``# activate all categories of tracing and turn     tracing on``\ ````
      ``trace -set all on     -on``\ ````
      ``# deactivate tracing without changing     categories for the next run``\ ````
      ``trace     -off``

 ``TRY``
~~~~~~~~

    ``/3 $[ try block ]$ CATCH $[ catch block ]$ : TRY and CATCH     on error or THROW``
     ``TRY ... CATCH`` provides a simple error-handling mechanism. If
    the system encounters an error during execution of the ``TRY``
    :ref:`block  <Execution_blocks>` then the ``CATCH`` block is entered.
    Otherwise, execution continues after the ``CATCH`` block.
     Ublu itself catches Java exceptions and a large number of error
    conditions. Any of these conditions or exceptions will cause entry
    to the ``CATCH`` block.
     No exception classes are provided and no bookkeeping is performed.
    Your program itself must place intermediate results in `tuple
    variables <#Tuple_Variables>`__ to be tested in the ``CATCH`` block
    to determine what happened.
     ``TRY .. CATCH`` can be nested to any practical depth.
     You can also :ref:`THROW <THROW>` an error in your program.
     *Example*
     ``as400 -to @as400 badname baduser     badpasswd``\ ````
    ``> TRY $[ put -to @foo ${ not     connected }$ as400 -- @as400 -connectsvc CENTRAL put -to @foo     ${ now connected }$ ]$ CATCH $[ put -from @foo ]$``

    -  -``false`` ``@tuplename`` sets *@tuplename* to the boolean
       ``false`` value
    -  ``-name`` ``@tuplename`` puts the name of the tuple named by
       @tuplename

       -  if applied to a real tuple variable, this returns the same

       tuple's value's class and whether is
       :ref:`autonomic  <Autonomic_Tuple_Variables>`.
    -  ``-autonomic @tuplename`` puts ``true`` if a the specific tuple's
       value's class is autonomic and ``false`` otherwise.
    -  ``-autonomes`` displays a list of all classes which allow a tuple
       to be :ref:`autonomic  <Autonomic_Tuple_Variables>`.

    |  The ``user`` command instances a User object to manipulate a user
      profile. If the :ref:`-as400 <System_Userid>`
      :ref:`dash-command  <Dash_Command>` is provided, then the arguments
      ``system userid`` and ``password`` must be omitted. If an
      instanced User object is suppled via the ``-user ~@user``
      dash-command then the ``-userprofile`` dash-command should be
      omitted.
    |  One way to get one or more User objects is via the
      :ref:`userlist <userlist>` command.
    |  The operations are as follows:

    -  ``-disable`` disables the user profile. It makes no difference if
       the user profile was already disabled.
    -  ``-enable`` enables the user profile. It makes no difference if
       the user profile was already enabled.
    -  ``-new,-instance`` instances the user profile and puts it to the
       destination :ref:`datasink  <Datasinks>` *``-instance`` is
       deprecated, use ``-new`` instead*.

       -  If the destination datasink is a file or standard output,
          effectively ``-instance`` prints out a nearly complete
          description of the user profile.

    -  ``-query`` *property* queries for the specified user profile
       property and puts the result. The following query strings are
       currently supported:

       -  ``curlib`` puts the user profile's current library.
       -  ``desc`` puts the user profile's text description.
       -  ``direntry`` puts the system distribution directory entry for
          the user profile, if one exists.
       -  ``exists`` puts ``true`` if the user profile exists, ``false``
          otherwise.
       -  ``homedir`` puts the IFS path to the user profile's home
          directory.
       -  ``msgq`` puts the IFS path to the user profile's message
          queue.
       -  ``name`` puts the name of the user profile.
       -  ``status`` puts the status of the user profile.
       -  ``storage`` puts the amount of auxiliary storage (in
          kilobytes) occupied by this user's owned objects.
       -  ``supplementalgroups`` puts the supplemental groups for the
          user profile.
       -  ``supplementalgroupsnum`` puts the number of supplemental
          groups for the user profile.

    -  ``-refresh`` refreshes from the host the data associated with the
       user.

    | The default operation in the absence of any operation dash-command
      is ``-instance``.

    **There are extensions for this command** coded in Ublu in
    ``extensions/ux.user.ublu``

 ``userlist``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    ``/3? [-as400 ~@as400] [-to datasink] [-userinfo     ~@{ALL|USER|GROUP|MEMBER}] [-groupinfo     ~@{NONE|NOGROUP|profilename}] [-userprofile ~@{username|*ALL}]     ~@{system} ~@{userid} ~@{password} : return a list of users        ``
     The userlist command puts a UserList object to the destination
    :ref:`datasink  <Datasinks>`. If the :ref:`-as400 <System_Userid>`
    dash-command is provided, then the arguments ``system userid`` and
    ``password`` must be omitted.
     The UserList can be iterated for its individual User objects.
     *Example*
     ``FUNC testUserList ( as400 ) $[``\ ```` ``    LOCAL @users``\ ````
    ``    userlist -to @users -as400     @@as400``\ ````
    ``    FOR @user in     @users $[ user -- @user -query name ]$``\ ````
    ``]$``\ ```` ````
    ``as400 -to @as400     mysys myuser mypassword``\ ````
    ``testUserList (     @as400 )``\ ```` *``FRED``\ ````*
    *``JIM``\ ````* *``SUZY``\ ````* *``QFOO``\ ````* *``...``*
     See also: :ref:`user <user>`

\ ``WHILE``
~~~~~~~~~~~

    ``/4 ~@whiletrue $[ cmd .. ]$ : WHILE @whiletrue iterate over     block``
     ``WHILE`` iterates over its block until the tuple (provided by name
    on the command line or popped from the `tuple
    stack <#Tuple_stack>`__ using the ``~`` symbol) *@whiletrue* returns
    ``false`` or a ``BREAK`` is encountered.
     *Example*
     ``tuple -true @continue``\ ```` ``lifo -push     @continue``\ ````
    ``put -to @index -#     -3``\ ```` ``WHILE ~ $[``\ ````
    ``        LOCAL     @i``\ ````
    ``        eval -to @index     + @index 1`` ````
    ``        put -to @i -from     @index``\ ````
    ``        lifo -push     @i``\ ````
    ``        put -s -n ${     index is }$ put -from ~``\ ````
    ``        eval -to @exit     == @index 7``\ ````
    ``        IF @exit THEN $[     BREAK ]$``\ ```` ``]$``\ ````
    ``put -n     -s ${ after WHILE, the index is }$ put -from     @index``\ ````
    ``put -n -s ${ tuple stack depth is     }$ lifo -depth``

``#`` *- or -* ``#!``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    | introduces a comment which continues to the end of the input line,
      either in interpretive mode or in reading a file via the
      :ref:`include <include>` command. Like all commands, it must be
      separated by at least one space from any following non-whitespace
      in order to be recognized.
    |  **Note** that line comments introduced by ``#`` should not be
      used inside an :ref:`execution block  <Execution_blocks>`, which is
      treated as a single line so the comment character devours
      everything to the end of the block. Inside of functions, use the
      ``\\`` command instead.

    The form ``#!`` is used as the first line of an executable shell
    script. The interpreter in such a shell script should be indicated
    as follows:

        ``#! /fully/qualified/path/to/java -jar       /fully/qualified/path/to/ublu.jar include``

    | (**Note** the blank space after the ``#!`` and before the path to
      java.)
    |  This assumes that ``ublu.jar`` resides in a directory containing
      a ``lib`` subdirectory with the several support .jar files used by
      Ublu (*see* :ref:`Invocation  <Invocation>`).
    |  **Note** that not all versions of the shell support the
      invocation syntax just as shown, i.e., it works on Mac Darwin but
      doesn't on some Linux shells.
    |  The script should be ``chmod u(go)+x`` and at runtime, the
      ``include`` directive at the end of the line ends up preceding the
      name of the script as provided by the shell, thus loading Ublu and
      executing the command :ref:`include <include>` *filename* .
    |  *Example*
    |  ``$ cat hello.ublu``\ ````
      *``#! /usr/bin/java     -jar /Users/jwoehr/NetBeansProjects/Ublu/dist/ublu.jar     include``\ ````*
      *``put ${ Hello,     world! }$``*\ ````
      ``$ chmod u+x     hello.ublu``\ ```` ``$     ./hello.ublu``\ ````
      *``:: #! /usr/bin/java -jar     /Users/jwoehr/NetBeansProjects/Ublu/dist/ublu.jar     include``\ ````*
      *``:: put ${ Hello,     world! }$``\ ````* *``Hello,     world!``*
      *````* *``::``*

``!``
-----

    | ``/1 history_linenumber``
    |  The "bang" command is a convenient shortcut for
      :ref:`history -do <history>` used to repeat a previous line.
      History must be on for this command to work.

        ``! 386``

    | is short for

        ``history -do 386``

    | **Note** that, unlike shell history, a space must separate the
      "bang" and the history linenumber.
    |  If ``!`` appears with the argument ``!`` then the most recent
      command which was not a ``!`` is repeated.
    |  **Note** that if the above ``! !`` abbreviation appears embedded
      in a recalled history line to be executed by ``!     !`` , the
      command line fails and issues an error message for recursive
      usage.

``\\``
------

    ``/1 [-to datasink] ${ some text, usually a comment }$      : redirect a quotation to a datasink or simply make an enclosed     comment``

| The ``\\`` ("comment-quote") command allows you to use a
  :ref:``${ quoted string   }$`` or single `plainword  <Plainwords>` for an
  enclosed comment. This is useful in defining functions (e.g., with
  :ref:`FUNC <FUNC>`) because the line comment command
  :ref:`# <comment_introducer>` can't be used in a function
  definition's :ref:`execution block  <Execution_blocks>` since it has the
  effect of consuming the entire remainder of the block.
|  The string can actually be redirected to a :ref:`datasink  <Datasinks>`
  by the :ref:``-to`` `dash-command  <Dash_Command>`, if desired. The
  default datasink for ``\\`` is set to ``NULL:``

 Tips and Tricks
================

Expert Tool
-----------

| Ublu is an expert tool for expert users. It is assumed the user is
  capable of shell scripting and shell one-liners. Examples are given
  below.

Shortening invocation
---------------------

| An easy way to make invoking Ublu involve less typing is to create a
  function in ``.bash_profile``, e.g.,

    ``function ublu () {``\ ````
    ``        java -jar /opt/ublu/ublu.jar $*``\ ```` ``    }``

Thereafter you can simply type ``ublu`` *arg arg ...* instead of
``java -jar /opt/ublu/ublu.jar`` *arg arg ...*

Making your Ublu script an executable shell script
--------------------------------------------------

See the  :ref:`#! <comment_introducer>` command example.

Recording a session
-------------------

| Either interpretive or simple command-line sessions can be recorded
  via shell i/o redirection.

    **``java -jar ublu.jar command args command     args 2>&1 | tee mysession.txt``**

Piping input to Ublu
--------------------

| You can pipe input into Ublu:

    **``echo "include somefile.ublu" | java -jar     ublu.jar``**

| When the input runs out from the redirection, Ublu will exit normally.
|  **Note** that the :ref:`interpret <interpret>` command will simply
  exit because there is no extra input for a nested interpeter session
  to be had when input is redirected in this fashion.

Defluff a CSV
-------------

Currently ASCII translation of EBCDIC character data is inserted
intercolumnarly in the output of ``db -csv`` if the db type is AS400 and
the column datatype is BINARY. Want to dump the hex output and just keep
the character columns?

    **``java -jar ublu.jar db -db as400 -csv SOMETABLE     somehost somedatabase someuser ******** | awk 'BEGIN {FS=","}     {printf("%s,%s,%s\n",$2,$4,$6)}' >SOMETABLE.txt``**

 Splitting a result set from an extant table into a new table
-------------------------------------------------------------

| The following program creates a new Postgres table, grabs a result set
  from an extant DB400 table and inserts it into the new Postgres table
  splitting one column of the extant table into several columns. In the
  example, the original table has three (3) columns, the last of which
  actually contains several different data entities all stuffed into the
  one column.

rssplitapavend.ublu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| ``db -db   postgres -query_nors ${ create table ap_avend (active bytea, id   bytea, name bytea, addr_1 bytea, addr_2 bytea, addr_3 bytea, city   bytea, state bytea, weird_bitmap bytea, buncha_ns bytea,   buncha_nonsense bytea, primary key   (active,id,name,addr_1,addr_2,addr_3,city,state,weird_bitmap,buncha_ns,buncha_nonsense))   }$ onesys test fred ********``\ ````
  ``db -db as400   -star ARF.FILE -to @srctable anothersys farfel fred   ********``\ ````
  ``db -db postgres -star ap_avend -to   @desttable onesys test fred ********``\ ````
  ``rs   -split 3 9 35 35 35 35 20 2 44 9 94 -toascii 3 1 2 3 -from   @srctable -to @desttable``\ ````
  ``rs -close   @srctable``\ ```` ``rs -close @desttable``

 Replicating a table and copying the data
-----------------------------------------

| To replicate table structure and copy in the data, the steps are:

#. Replicate the empty table structure.
#. Get a result set from the source table.
#. Get an (empty) result set from the destination table.
#. Use the rs command to copy the source result set to the destination
   result set.
#. Close the result sets.

| Two examples follow, one where the autogenerator generates the primary
  keys, and the second one where the primary keys are provided to the
  command.

testreplicate.ublu - the primary keys are automatically generated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``#! /usr/bin/java -jar   /Users/jwoehr/NetBeansProjects/Ublu/dist/ublu.jar   include``\ ````
``db -db as400 -replicate ARF.FILE   onesys postgres test fred ********* testsojac farfel fred   *********``\ ````
``db -db as400 -query ${ SELECT *   FROM "ARF.FILE" }$ -to @srctable anothersys farfel fred   *********``\ ````
``db -db postgres -query ${ SELECT   * FROM "ARF.FILE" }$ -to @desttable onesys test fred   *********``\ ````
``rs -insert -toascii 3 1 2 3 -from   @srctable -to @desttable``
``rs -closedb @desttable   rs -closedb @srctable   put ${ Done replication and data copy. }$``

Here is the above script running:

``$ ./testreplicate.ublu`` ````
``:: #!   /usr/bin/java -jar   /Users/jwoehr/NetBeansProjects/Ublu/dist/ublu.jar   include``\ ````
``:: db -db as400 -replicate ARF.FILE   sojac postgres test fred ********* testsojac farfel fred   *********``\ ````
``Aug 04, 2013 5:57:46 PM   ublu.db.TableReplicator replicate``\ ````
``INFO:   Table creation SQL is CREATE TABLE "ARF.FILE" ( F00001 varchar   NOT NULL, K00001 varchar NOT NULL, F00002 varchar NOT NULL,   PRIMARY KEY (F00001, K00001, F00002) )``\ ````
``::   db -db as400 -query ${ SELECT * FROM "ARF.FILE" }$ -to @srctable   testsojac farfel fred *********``\ ````
``:: db -db   postgres -query ${ SELECT * FROM "ARF.FILE" }$ -to @desttable   sojac test fred *********``\ ````
``:: rs -insert   -toascii 3 1 2 3 -from @srctable -to @desttable   :: rs -closedb @desttable   :: rs -closedb @srctable   :: put ${ Done replication and data copy. }$   Done replication and data copy.``
``$``

| Even simpler than the above is to replace the two query lines above
  with the following lines:

| ``db -db as400 -star ARF.FILE -to @srctable testsojac farfel   fred *********``\ ````
  ``db -db postgres -star   ARF.FILE -to @desttable sojac test fred *********``

| using ``db -star`` to formulate automatically the ``SELECT * FROM``
  query.

Afterwards of course you can view your handiwork:

| ``java -jar ublu.jar db -db postgres -star ARF.FILE sojac   test fred ********``

replicate - the primary keys are provided to the command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| Here is an example of replication when it is desired to provide
  manually the primary key list to table replication
|  ````
  ``db -db as400 -pklist ${ FOO BAR WOOF ARF ZOTZ   }$ -replicate SNORK 1.2.3.4 postgres test fred ******** 5.6.7.8   farfel fred ********``\ ````
  ``db -db as400 -property   ${ block size }$ 512 -star PPPOLICY -to @srctable 5.6.7.8 farfel   fred ********``\ ````
  ``db -db postgres -star SNORK   -to @desttable 1.2.3.4 test fred ********``\ ````
  ``rs -insert -from @srctable -to @desttable``\ ````
  ``rs -closedb @desttable``\ ```` ``rs -closedb   @srctable``

Saving history as a program
---------------------------

| You can save command history as a program, either temporarily in a
  tuple variable or by writing history lines to a file.

    ``> history -range 214 215`` ````
    *``put     ${ this is a first line }$``* *````*
    *``put ${ this is a second line }$``* ```` ````
    ``> history -range 214 215 -to     @myProgram``\ ````
    ``> put -from     @myProgram``\ ````
    *``put ${ this is a first line     }$``* *````*
    *``put ${ this is a second     line }$``* *````* ````
    ``>     include -from @myProgram``\ ````
    *``:: put ${     this is a first line }$``* *````*
    *``this is a first line``* *````*
    *``:: put ${ this is a second line }$``* *``     ``*
    *``this is a second line``* ````
    ``> put -from @myProgram -to     myProgram.ublu``\ ````
    ``> put -from     myProgram.ublu``\ ````
    *``put ${ this is a first     line }$``* *````*
    *``put ${ this is a     second line }$``* *````* ````
    ``> include myProgram.ublu``\ ````
    *``:: put     ${ this is a first line }$``* *````*
    *``this is a first line``* *````*
    *``:: put ${ this is a second line }$``* *``     ``*
    *``this is a second line``* ```` ``>`` ````

 Searching for tables in the i Series database
----------------------------------------------

| *Submitted by Kevin McGinnis*

.. raw:: html

   <div>

.. raw:: html

   <div>

To obtain info on all tables in the i Series db use the command:
    ``db -db as400 -query ${ select * from SYSTABLES }$         myhost QSYS2 qsecofr ********``

.. raw:: html

   </div>

To obtain a result set listing all the tables in a library SOMELIB the
command can be modified to:
    ``db -db as400 -query ${ select * from SYSTABLES where       SYSTEM_TABLE_SCHEMA = 'SOMELIB' }$ myhost QSYS2 qsecofr       *********``

.. raw:: html

   </div>

| To obtain an ordered list of the tables in a library SOMELIB the
  command can be modified to:

    ``db -db as400 -query ${ select TABLE_NAME from SYSTABLES     where SYSTEM_TABLE_SCHEMA = 'SOMELIB' order by 1 }$ myhost     QSYS2 qsecofr xx``

 Get a list of active interactive jobs and search that list for specific jobs
