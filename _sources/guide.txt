Who is this Guide for?
======================

It's for people who just want an introduction to using Ublu, or who have
downloaded and built Ublu, read enough of the :ref:`references <Intro>` to know
how to launch `Ublu <https://github.com/jwoehr/ublu>`__, and now want more help
understanding Ublu.

.. note::
    The Guide is meant to be easy to read, and extra stuff you may not want
    to bother with is written as a note, like this.

Why Ublu?
=========

Ublu is an interpretive language for remote systems programming of
midrange or mainframe hosts from a Java platform such as Linux, Mac,
OpenBSD or Windows. It also can run natively on IBM i ®, IBM z/OS USS ®
or any other reasonable Java platform.

I wrote Ublu because I wanted a language to run on
OpenBSD/Mac/Linux/Windows to perform ad-hoc process automation primarily
on IBM i Series OS ®. I was supporting consulting clients by writing
individual utility programs using JTOpen which I have used since 1998 to
control the AS/400. I decided to consolidate the programs in a language,
and the result is Ublu.

Additionally, Ublu can call Java directly allowing the user him- or
herself to extend the language interpretively in nearly any direction
desired.

It is convenient to operate legacy systems remotely from modern
environments:

-  Use Ublu to empower help-desk folks who know how to feed arguments to
   scripts and answer interactive prompts but are challenged by the
   green screen.
-  Intermediate programmers use Ublu as an easy entry point to legacy
   systems programming.
-  Teams working to design add-ons or extensions to legacy applications
   can use Ublu.
-  Teams designing follow-on systems who need to explore the legacy
   environment can use Ublu.
-  Ublu also runs locally on IBM i Series OS and is sometimes used to
   model programs which later may be written in straight Java to run
   locally on the server.

.. note::
    I also previously wrote `PigIron <http://pigiron.sourceforge.net/>`__, a
    Java bridge to IBM z/VM ® System Management API `(SMAPI)
    <https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSB27U_6.3.0/com.ibm.zvm.v630.dmse6/toc.htm?lang=en>`__.
    I provide PigIron support in Ublu. I had been using my `FIJI ForthIsh Java
    Interpreter <http://fiji.sourceforge.net/>`__ to drive PigIron, which works
    very well but is arcane, and also `ObjectRexx <http://www.oorexx.org/>`__,
    which is a wonderful language which doesn't run on as many platforms as
    Java. Ublu turns out to be an excellent language environment for PigIron
    SMAPI operations.

Ublu is a new language which was coded quick and easy in Java on top of
other open source libraries. The "quick and easy" approach derives from
a work environment in which folks just wanted results and had no
particular interest in the language itself.

Ublu is easy to build, install, read, and use. It is handsome but not
beautiful. Ublu works like an interactive shell scripting language but
also has some advanced language features such as compiling, tasking,
debugging and a TCP/IP port server mode.

Work in Progress
----------------

Ublu is a work in progress and, like all "living" software, likely to remain
so. There are always more aspects to IBM i programming to support. Everything
that's in Ublu is there because I/We needed it *right then*. The ``db`` command
was almost the first thing added, which is effectively an interpretive shell
around JDBC. On the other hand, we never needed classic record file access
because everyone on staff was SQL-oriented and knew little about physical file
access.  Thus, only recently have I added the ```file`` <ubluref.html#file>`__
and ``record`` commands for classic record file access.

If you find Ublu useful, please `let me know <http://www.softwoehr.com/>`__!

If you find a bug, or wish to issue a feature request, you can `create an issue
in the issue tracker <https://github.com/jwoehr/ublu/issues/new>`__.

What does Ublu do?
==================

- Ublu is an interpreter with full language features such as flow
  control (``IF``, ``ELSE``, ``DO``, ``WHILE`` etc.), exception handling, and even a
  multitasker and debugger.
- Ublu has commands that manipulate Java objects representing objects,
  services and various facilities on the remote server.
- In Ublu you can define functions to create complex programs to
  manipulate the remote server and its databases, tape drives,
  whatever.
- You can also do `Postgresql <http://www.postgresql.org/>`__
  databasing (and pretty much anything else) on your local computer,
  allowing you to interoperate your local database with the database on
  the remote server.
- You can do this interactively or load a program from text files which can,
  in turn, :ref:`include <include>` other text files.
- You can automate a telnet 5250 terminal emulator session.
- You can interact directly with the underlying Java and class
  libraries.

When you've got your complete application written in Ublu, there's an Ublu
command :ref:`gensh <gensh>` which autogenerates a shell script to work under
either ``bash`` or ``ksh``. The script takes arguments via command-line
switches and pass them to your program's top-level function. *The script
effects a closure on your top-level function.*

For a formal summary of everything, see the rest of the reference, probably
starting at the :ref:`intro <Intro>`.  That Reference tells you how to install
and run Ublu and lists the Open Source project dependencies as well as
documenting every command and facility built into Ublu.

Discussing Ublu Online
======================

Currently I discuss Ublu on the `Ublu, Java & JTOpen forum
<https://ibmioss.ryver.com/index.html#forums/1057363>`__ of the `OSS on IBM i
Ryver team <https://ibmioss.ryver.com/index.html>`__.

Quick Tour of the Ublu Language
===============================

Overview
--------

Ublu is mostly composed of commands and a language interpreter. There are also
are other Ublu features such as server mode and the tasker, but commands and
the language interpreter are the nexus.

Commands
--------

Ublu commands are like individual application programs which are invoked with
their arguments under the language interpreter. Command arguments are often
references to objects which have been created by other commands. You usually
don't have to know much about objects passed from command to command other than
what they're supposed to represent.

Most arguments are passed to the `dash-commands <ubluref.html#Dash_Command>`__
associated with the command, e.g.::

    ask -to @answer -say ${ Do you wish to reply to this message? (y/n) }$

The ``ask`` command here has two dash-commands, ``-to`` and ``-say``.  ``-to``
has an argument which says to which :ref:`variable <Tuple Variables>` to put
the answer to the question about to be asked the user, and ``-say`` takes a
:ref:`quoted string <Quoted Strings>` which is the prompt to the user.

Language Interpreter
--------------------

The heart of the Ublu language is a text interpreter loop. There can be
multiple nested or branching interpreter instances with different variable
spaces in one Ublu session, but basically they're all doing the same sort of
thing: an outer input loop is getting input and running an inner interpretive
:ref:`loop  <ublu.util.Interpreter.loop>` to interpret a single line of text.

.. note::
    There are actually several different but very similar loops, e.g.,
    the debugger interpreter loop is different from the normal runtime
    intepreter loop.

Parsing is very simplistic. The parse parses, and having parsed, moves on,
`*nor can all your piety and wit*
<https://www.google.com/search?q=nor+can+all+your+piety+and+wit>`__ make it go
back one *lex* (unit of parsing).

The text interpreter loop parses the next whitespace-delimited element (a lex)
and tries to locate it as an Ublu command or as a defined function. Matching is
case-sensitive.

If no match is found, the loop falls out to the outer input loop with an error.
The outer loop then waits for more input to pass to the inner interpretive
loop.

If the interpretive loop succeeds in finding the next lex in the input as a
command or function, it passes the rest of the line to the command or to the
function interpreter. Both do their work then pass back the remnant of the
input line that wasn't consumed in their work.

Thus, line processing is a relay: the loop hands off to the command/function,
which then hands back to loop, and on to next command/function ... until the
line is consumed or an error is encountered.

If an error is encountered, the rest of the input is discarded.  Typically the
interpretive loop will fall out to the outer parsing loop. However, there is a
``TRY CATCH THROW`` exception facility in Ublu allowing the program to catch
errors without losing its place in the executing program.

While the interpretive loop is line-oriented, certain constructs can span
lines, particularly a delimited string or an execution block.  Strings are
delimited::

    ${ like this }$


and execution blocks::

    $[ like this ]$

so it is easy for the loop to identify them and demand another line from the
outer loop if the closing delimiter hasn't been found yet.

Language control flow constructs are just a form of command.  Typically they
consume execution blocks from the input::

    IF @truefalse THEN $[
        command arg arg command arg arg
        command arg ...
    ]$ ELSE $[
        command arg ...
    ]$


As noted, these execution blocks can span multiple lines.

A Full Ublu Program
===================

Here is a full Ublu program. It uses `FUNC <./ubluref.html#FUNC>`__ to define a
number of functions allowing the user to checks a message queue on an i Series
OS server and lists the messages, asking the user on each if s/he would like to
reply, and parsing the reply if one is given.  Take a look at the program (and
its associate shell script given here) and then we will `discuss the program
line-by-line <#Understanding_examplesautoreply.ublu>`__ below.

``examples/autoreply.ublu``

      30             msgq -- @msgq -sendreplybinkey @key @reply
      31             put ${ Reply sent. }$
      32         ]$
      33     ]$
      34 ]$

Understanding ``examples/autoreply.ublu``
-----------------------------------------

::

       1 # autoreply.ublu ... Find and reply to all *INQ & *NOTIFY messages in a given MSGQ
       2 # jack j. woehr jwoehr@absolute-performance.com jwoehr@softwoehr.com
       3 # 2015-03-10
       4 

These lines are, of course, comments. Comments go to the end of the line.

As we discussed above, execution blocks (e.g., the body of a function)
delimited by ``$[`` and ``]$`` can span lines. The way the interpretive loop
does this is that it keeps calling for input from the outer parsing loop until
it finds the closing delimiter.  Effectively, the entire execution block is one
line. So line comments (those commented by the :ref:`# <comment introducer>`
command) should not be placed inside function bodies or they will comment out
the entire function body! Instead, inside functions use the :ref:`\\ <comment
quote>` command.

::

    6 FUNC getMsgQ ( system user password ifspath msgq ) $[
    7     LOCAL @as400
    8     as400 -to @as400 @@system @@user @@password
    9     msgq -to @@msgq -as400 @as400 -instance @@ifspath
    10 ]$

Here the function ``getMsgQ`` is defined. The argument list is not typed in any
way. These are merely token names for whatever will appear in that position
inside the parentheses when the function is invoked. Inside the body of the
function these arguments will be referenced by prefixing them with ``@@`` e.g.,
``@@password``.

.. note::
    the parentheses are separated from both the function name and from the
    argument list!!

.. note::
    In the example, I happened to use the bad style of naming arguments the
    same name as Ublu commands (``system``* *``user``* *and ``msgq``) which, of
    course, the editor then syntax-colored, mistaking them for keywords. This
    is entirely legal in Ublu but, again, it's bad style.

The function body is the execution block between ``$[`` and ``]$``

On line 7, a local variable is declared. All variables ("tuple variables" as
they are called, or just "tuples") are identified by the ``@`` prefix, whether
they are ``LOCAL`` or global (or interpreter-level-local).

Tuple variables come into existence just by being mentioned.  Arguments to a
function may be tuples or plain words, Ublu commands typically know what to do
with either when passed them as arguments.

The LOCAL declaration ``LOCAL @as400`` serves to says that there will be a
local tuple variable which will hide any other variables of the same name in
the program while in this execution block and then disappear at the end of the
execution block, i.e., at the end of function execution. Equally, the variable
name ``@as400`` could have been used without declaration, but then it would
persist beyond the end of the function, and further, if there happened to
already exist such a variable in the program, it would be referencing that same
variable, possibly unintentionally.

Lines 8 and 9 are Ublu commands.

Line 8 says, "Create a remote server instance for the system function argument
using the user and password function arguments. Store that instance in the
declared local variable ``@as400``".

Line 9 says, "Create an object referencing the message queue on the server
represented by ``@as400`` and identified by the IFS path represented by the
function argument ``ifspath`` and store that object to the function argument
``msgq`` , presumably a variable, with an error resulting if a variable was not
provided in that position in the function argument list."

The variable named which is provided in the function argument list in that
position does not have to be named anything like the declaring argument list
named it. It could be called ``@fred`` for instance. It does not even have to
have been previously declared. It comes into global existence by being named.
It can later be deleted via the ``tuple -delete @fred`` command, if so desired.
Or, it might be a LOCAL variable from a calling function.

::

      13 FUNC getReplyMsgs ( msgq replylist ) $[
      14     msgq -- @@msgq -query -reply -to @@replylist
      15 ]$


These lines declare another function which says, "Given a message queue
instance and a variable name in which to store the result of this function,
create a list of messages needing reply waiting on the remoted i Series OS
message queue represented by the message queue instance."

::

    18 FUNC autoreply ( system user password ifspath ) $[
    19     LOCAL @msgq LOCAL @replylist LOCAL @key
    20     LOCAL @answer LOCAL @tf LOCAL @reply
    21     getMsgQ ( @@system @@user @@password @@ifspath @msgq )
    22     getReplyMsgs ( @msgq @replylist )
    23     FOR @msg in @replylist $[
    24         msg -- @msg -to @key -key
    25         put -from @msg
    26         ask -to @answer -say ${ Do you wish to reply to this message? (y/n) }$
    27         test -to @tf -eq @answer y
    28         IF @tf THEN $[
    29             ask -to @reply -say ${ Please enter your reply }$
    30             msgq -- @msgq -sendreplybinkey @key @reply
    31             put ${ Reply sent. }$
    32         ]$
    33     ]$
    34 ]$
    35 

These lines declare ``autoreply`` which is the top-level function in the file.
Note that we declared these functions from low-level to top level. This is not
necessary, since the functions are not interpreted until called, but it's
easier to understand this way.

.. note::
    Ublu function definitions offer almost no compiler security. They are simply
    parsed and stored as execution blocks associated with a call specification and
    no validation of their runtime action is performed.

``autoreply`` takes as its arguments a system name, user id, password and IFS
path. Arguments to the function, whether they are plainwords or variables are
referenced inside the function by their declared name decorated with ``@@`` .
If a function is declared::

    FUNC foo ( bar )


then the argument ``bar`` is referenced inside the body of the function as
``@@bar``::

    FUNC foo ( bar ) $[ put -from @@bar ]$


``autoreply`` also declares a few local variables that will hide global and
more outer local variables of the same name and then disappear at the end of
the execution block in which they are declared.

``autoreply`` calls the function ``getMsgQ`` to get the message queue
instance.

``autoreply`` then calls ``getReplyMsgs`` to get a list messages awaiting a
reply.

``autoreply`` then loops in a ``FOR`` loop through the list and uses ``ask``
command to ask the user if the user wishes to reply each individual message. It
does ``test`` on the response against the character ``y`` and ``IF`` the result
of that test is true, gets a reply via ``ask`` and replies to the message
queue, informing the user via ``put`` that the reply was sent.

Generating launcher scripts for Ublu programs via ``gensh``
===========================================================


The ``autoreply`` program would still require understanding of Ublu to load and
execute, but our help desk operator doesn't have to deal with that. As noted
above, the Ublu :ref:`gensh <gensh>` command can generate a shell script so
that ``autoreply`` can become effectively a shell command that takes options to
identify system and queue. 

.. note::
    ``gensh`` shell scripts allow the designer to turn Ublu functions into
    closures.

Here is the ``gensh``-generated  shell script to run the top-level function
``autoreply`` from the program ``autoreply.ublu``

``examples/autoreply.sh``

Some Obvious Questions about Ublu
=================================

The above explanations raise several new questions:

-  :ref:`What are the data types in Ublu? <What are the data types in Ublu>`
-  :ref:`What are those dash thingies after Ublu commands? <What are those dash thingies after Ublu commands>`
-  :ref:`What is a put? <What is a put>`
-  :ref:`How are arguments passed? <How are arguments passed>`

We'll answer those questions next.

.. _What are the data types in Ublu:

What are the data types in Ublu?
--------------------------------

Ublu can be described as an "object-disoriented language".

Ublu is a form of interpretive Java that hides as much as possible
about object usage.

There are basically three data types in the Ublu language:

#. plainword
#. object
#. variable
#. string
#. execution block

A **plainword** is a single whitespace-delimited lex

-  ``arthur``
-  ``99999``
-  ``supercalifra$gilist$ticexpialifoobar..**(())``

An **object** represents something or other, often a something-or-other on a
remote server but it's pretty opaque and you just have to know which  objects
you have in hand go with which Ublu commands. It's mostly simple to do because
the same commands that use the objects typically provide the objects in the
first place.

Objects are passed around in **variables** ("tuple variables" or "tuples")
marked with the ``@`` sign. Variables come into existence by being mentioned.
If they're in an execution block between ``$[`` and ``]$`` they can be marked
``LOCAL`` and disappear at the end of the block. Otherwise, they persist until
expressly deleted or until the interpreter in whose context they reside exits.

A string in Ublu is parsed from a sequence of plainwords wrapped by  ``${`` and
``}$`` e.g. ``${ hi there }$`` Many commands in Ublu will take either a string,
a plainword, or a variable as an argument. This is symbolized in the command
descriptions in the Ublu Reference by ``~@{something}``. 

.. note::
    The ~ means also that the argument to the dash-command can be popped from
    Ublu's LIFO stack. 

An execution block is a body of Ublu program text wrapped in ``$[`` and ``]$``
. Execution blocks are used as the body of control constructs, such as ``IF``
... ``THEN`` ... ``ELSE`` , function definitions and ``TRY`` ... ``CATCH`` ,
e.g.::

    IF @trueorfalse THEN $[ joblist -as400 @myserver -to @jl     ]$

.. _What are those dash thingies after Ublu commands:

What are those dash thingies after Ublu commands?
-------------------------------------------------

The dash-commands after Ublu commands pass arguments to the command, often
objects being kept in variables.::

    as400 -to @myServer somehostname.com someuserid somepassword
    joblist -as400 @myServer


would retrieve a joblist from ``somehostname.com`` provided ``someuserid`` had
authorization to request it.

One special dash-command is double-dash ``--`` the :ref:`eponymous dash-command
<Eponymous dash-command>` which represents an object identified in the command
description with same name as the command itself. For example, the ``as400``
command instances and operates on objects representing a connection to a remote
i Series OS server.  Once you have instanced such an object and stored it ``-to
@someServer`` you can use it and then later test if it is still connected by
passing the same variable back to the ``as400`` command like this::

    as400 -as400 @someServer -connected

which will ``put`` either ``true`` or ``false``. But you could also have simply
used the :ref:`eponymous dash-command <Eponymous dash-command>`::

    as400 -- @someServer -connected

since, for the as400 command, ``--`` represents ``-as400``.

.. _What is a put:

What is a ``put`` ?
-------------------

The ``as400`` command stored ``-to @myServer`` which variable was then passed
to joblist command as ``-as400 @myServer``

``-to`` is a dash-command to almost every Ublu command. It says where the
``put`` is to go.

Most Ublu commands ``put`` a result. That result could be text or an object. If
no ``-to`` destination is specified, then the ``put`` goes to standard out. If
the result is an object and the ``put`` is to standard out,  the object is
rendered in text. Ublu knows how to render objects in text in a useful fashion.

The full discussion of ``put`` requires an understanding of `Data Sinks
<Datasinks>` discussed in the Ublu Reference.

.. _How are arguments passed:

How are arguments passed?
-------------------------

Arguments in Ublu are passed by reference, not by value.

When you pass a variable as an argument to a command or function, that variable
is accessible to the function and any changes the function makes to that
argument are changes to the variable itself.

Arguments in function argument lists are actually :ref:`token-pasted <Function
Parameter Bindings>` into the execution block which is the body of the
function.

Token pasting in function argument marshalling allows some unusual programming
techniques as we'll see later, e.g., in the section on the :ref:`Tuple Stack
<The Tuple Stack>`.

Local variables as arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Local variables only are accessible within the execution block in which they
are declared. This encompassed nested blocks within the declaring block (unless
a local of the same name is declared in the inner block, thus hiding the outer
block's local).

This means you can pass a local as a positional argument to a function called
within a block and that function can reference the provided value normally.::

    FUNC bar ( myarg ) $[ put -from @@myarg ]$
    FUNC foo ( ) $[
        LOCAL @a
        put -to @a 17
        bar ( @a )
    ]$

``foo ( )`` when invoked will display the number 17.

A limit on local variables as arguments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Because calls are by reference and locals have only block scope, there exist
cases where it appears you can pass a local to a function but you really
cannot. Here's an instance of that:

``examples/test/localvarthread.ublu``

In the above example, a thread is launched with a string argument, effectively
an execution block although passed as a string in a variable. Even though the
thread is launched in the same execution block as the local variable
declaration, the thread's runtime environment is not nested within the
execution block, so a local variable cannot be passed to the thread.

The ``examples`` directory
==========================

Ublu is distributed with an ``examples`` directory. Most of these are code
actually used in production, though of course **there is NO WARRANTY OR
GUARANTY of correctness or fitness for a given application (see the LICENSE)**.

Example files consist of definitions of functions embodying factors of common
operations, and of the shell scripts generated by ``gensh`` used to launch the
functions.  Not all examples are pristine examples of Ublu coding style, which
is evolving. Generally, the more parameterization, the better.

The test directory
------------------

Under the ``examples`` directory is the ``test`` directory which are fairly
crude regression code used to test the basic functionality of Ublu commands.

The ``extensions`` directory
============================

Ublu is distributed with an ``extensions`` directory which contains
extensions to the base Ublu system which are written in Ublu itself.

As the IBM i system upon which Ublu primarily operates is so feature-rich, it
is impractical to put every useful utility in the base system. Therefore, as
Ublu evolves, more and more features will likely be relegated to the
``extensions`` directory to be loaded via :ref:`include <include>` as needed by
the application programmer.

Again, **there is NO WARRANTY OR GUARANTY of correctness or fitness for a given
application (see the LICENSE)**.

Object-disoriented
==================

A few words about "object-disoriented". Object languages associate methods with
specific data structures and define these relationships in classes. Ublu began
as a collection of single-purpose utilities designed procedurally and then grew
into a language when it became necessary to pass objects from utility to
utility in order to get more useful work done.

You have seen how Ublu works and :ref:`read about the put command <put>`. The
``put`` command was the beginning of Ublu "object-disorientation". When Ublu
emerged from the need to pass objects rather than string values from one
utility to the next, the ``put`` command was an immediate result of that change
to an interpretive language. I needed to see quickly what was going on.

A lot of effort went into ``put`` so it would give useful insight into anything
passed around from command to command in Ublu without demanding that the
programmer remember what was where. It is always safe to simply ``put @foo``
because a useful string representation is returned. And ``put -to @bar   @foo``
put whatever is in ``@foo`` also into ``@bar`` without worrying about object
class.

What Ublu's language structure comes down to is that:

-  commands are effectively *classes*
-  dash-commands are effectively *methods*
-  the object values passed in tuple vars to the commands are the
   *object instances* multiply inheriting from the *classes*.

   -  Multiple inheritance because the *object instances* respond to the
      *methods* of many *classes*

E.g, in the example ...::

    as400 -to @sys mysys myuid mypwd
    as400 -- @sys -alivesvc CENTRAL
    true

... effectively, an Ublu ``as400`` *class* creates an *object instance* stored
in ``@sys``. That object has a method ``alivesvc(CENTRAL)`` invoked on it.

Ublu's default "object-disoriented" syntax is wordier than a true object
language, in that the class is named each time (the "command"), but it tends to
be easy to use interpretively. It's clunky, yet it is reminiscent of
traditional "big iron"-style command syntax and is pretty easy to remember.

Autonomes offer easier syntax
-----------------------------

:ref:`Autonomes <Autonomic Tuple Variables>` simplify Ublu syntax. An
*autonome* is a tuple variable whose value is of one of many recognized types
allowed by Ublu to stand for its most typical command and the :ref:`eponymous
dash-command <Eponymous dash-command>`.

Thus, assuming that ``@job`` contains a valid instance created by the :ref:`job
command <job>`,::

    job -- @job -info

can be expressed::

    @job -info

.. _The Tuple Stack:

The Tuple Stack
===============

The `Forth programming language
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)>`__ taught me the
use of a LIFO stack in programming. The Ublu :ref:`Tuple stack <Tuple stack>`
allows some interesting programming metaphors that allow coding functions that
get around some of the clunkiness of basic Ublu syntax. Instead of stowing
results in tuple variables, functions can push their results to the stack to be
popped as arguments by the next function.  Additionally, the
:ref:`token-pasting <Function Parameter Binding>` nature of Ublu :ref:`FUNC
<FUNC>` arguments allow even dash-commands to be presented to an Ublu command
via the argument list to a function.

Here is an example (``examples/stringpush.ublu``) of this object-disoriented
slackomorphic style of programming:

::

    1  # stringpush.ublu
    2  # Example from Ublu Midrange and Mainframe Life Cycle Extension language
    3  # https://github.com/jwoehr/ublu
    4  # Copyright (C) 2016 Jack J. Woehr http://www.softwoehr.com
    5  # See the Ublu license (BSD-2 open source)
    6  
    7  # Execute the string command providing the op and 2 arguments
    8  # and push the result to the tuple LIFO stack
    9  # Example: $-2 ( -cat ~ ~ ) will pop the tuple stack twice,
    10 # concatenate the two string values and push the result back.
    11 FUNC $~2 ( op a b ) $[ string -to ~ @@op @@a @@b ]$
    12 # Here's an example session:
    13 # > put -to ~ ${ arf arf arf }$
    14 # > put -to ~ ${ foo bar woof }$
    15 # > $~2 ( -cat ~ ~ )
    16 # > put ~
    17 # foo bar woof arf arf arf
    18 # ...
    19 # Note that "the first shall be last".
    20 # ...
    21 # > put -to ~ ${ arf arf arf }$
    22 # > put -to ~ ${ arf arf arf }$
    23 # > $~2 ( -eq ~ ~ )
    24 # > put ~
    25 # true
    26 
    27 # end
    28 

Calling Java
============

Ublu can call Java directly via the :ref:`calljava <calljava>` command. This
allows the user to extend the language interpretively in nearly any direction
desired.  This is useful, because as I continually extend Ublu, it is not
practical to support every option for every object in the JTOpen library with
Ublu sytax.

For instance, at present writing, there is no Ublu dash-command to fetch the
reply status of a queued message. Maybe I'll add that later, if I need it
enough. For the present, if I need that reply status, I ``calljava`` on the
queued message object easily obtainable from Ublu.

::

    > as400 -to @mysys MYSYS.ORG MYPROFILE MYPASSWORD
    > joblog -to @jl -as400 @mysys -new MYJOBNAME MYUID 349989
    > joblog -to ~ -- @jl -length
    > joblog -- @jl -to ~ -qm 0 ~
    > FOR @i in ~ $[ calljava -obj @i -method getReplyStatus -to @result put @result ]$

Of course, in this sort of programming, downloading and perusing the
Ublu javadocs and JTOpen library javadocs is essential. In the example
above, one would have to know that Ublu's ``joblog -qm`` is returning a
collection of ``com.ibm.as400.access.QueuedMessage`` instances.
